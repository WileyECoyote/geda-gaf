  Checklist: Inserting images in gschem Source Documentation

  1.0 Is desired image drawn in gschem?

     Yes:

        1.1 Put .sch file in docs/images/ directory.
        1.2 Add the file name to sch_images in docs/images/Makefile.am

     No:

        1.3 Generate the image
        1.4 Put image file in docs/dialogs
        1.5 Add the file name to dialogimages_DATA in docs/dialogs/Makefile.am


  2.0 Include the image file name, including the relative directory, to the
      HTML_EXTRA_FILES and LATEX_EXTRA_FILES lists in docs/gschem.dox.


  3.0 Add the appropriate DOxygen tags, such as \image html or \image latex,
      in a DOxygen comment block somewhere in the code or as a seperate text
      file. An example of using a text is the file docs/gschem-main.txt. Note
      that seperate files must be included either by the preprocessor or by
      DOxygen using the INPUT tag.


  4.0 Generaly, images inserted in latex should have a caption and may require
      "fitting", for an example see src/x/x_confirm_close.c.


  5.0 Generate/Re-generate the DOxygen output using "make doxygen", either in
      top-level or gschem directory.


  6.0 Verify the new image has been properly inserted in the DOxygen output.
