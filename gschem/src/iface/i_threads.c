 *  \remarks
 *
 *  1.) glib Idles, Timeouts and IO callbacks are executed outside of the
 *      main GTK+ lock, but not signal handlers. To call GTK+ routines that
 *      involve X11 manipulation of the display, inside of such a callback,
 *      wrap the call with gschem_threads_enter and gschem_threads_leave.
 *
 *  2.) Since gschem_threads_init calls gdk_threads_set_lock_functions, all
 *      internal Gdk calls are redirected to our gschem_threads_enter and
 *      gschem_threads_leave handlers.
