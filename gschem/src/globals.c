/*! \brief General Purpose Global GList Buffers
 *  \par Description
 * Gschem currently uses 8 glist buffers, there used to be 6,
 * with system clipboard data errently mixed between 0 and 1.
 * So a separate glist was created in the toplevel, clipboard
 * _buffer. The next five buffers are the buffers in the menu
 * labeled 1 through 5, these are object_buffer[0] thru object
 * _buffer[4].
 * Currently, object_buffer[5] and object_buffer[6] are not
 * used. object_buffer[7] is used by Drag & Drop.
