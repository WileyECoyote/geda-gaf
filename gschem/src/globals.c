/*! \brief General Purpose Global GList Buffers
 *  \par Description
 * Gschem currently uses 7 glist buffers, the first 5 are used
 * as auxillary clipboard buffers. These are the buffers in the
 * menu labeled 1 through 5, cooresponding to object_buffer[0]
 * thru object_buffer[4]. The system clipboard is not mixed with
 * these buffers. The system clipboard data is stored in toplevel
 * member clipboard_buffer.
 * Currently, object_buffer[5] and object_buffer[6] are not used,
 * object_buffer[7] is used by Drag & Drop.
