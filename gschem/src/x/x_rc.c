/*! \brief This Function is used to Recover from Unbound Variables.
 *  \par Function Description
 *  This function is not normally executed. If an unbound variable is
 *  encountered while processing an initialization file, this function
 *  is assigned to that variable. What the function does is not so much
 *  important as it's existent. When the same initialization file is
 *  reprocessed, the variable is no longer unbound. If the would be
 *  variable had been defined like (typo "enabled") or (type 1), then
 *  cadr is returned, otherwise <b>UNDEFINED</b> is returned.

/*! \brief Error handler function used by x_rc_parse_gschem.
 * \par Function Description
 *  The file is called from functions in Libgeda, after an error was
 *  encountered processing an RC initialization file. If a valid err
 *  pointer is passed the error is interrogated. Missing RC files are
 *  not reported. For other errors, a descriptive message is logged
 *  and a dialog is displayed to inform the user of the error. If the
 *  error did not include a message then the error is reported as
 *  unknown. If the error was due to an  "Unbound variable", then a
 *  scheme subroutine is assigned to the string name and the integer
 *  pointed to by the second argument is incremented to indicated
 *  that another attempt should be made to process the RC file.
 *
 * \param err         A point to a ponter to a Gerror structure.
 * \param retry_flag  Pointer to current retry count.

/*! \brief Load gschem configuration files and display error dialogs.
 * \par Function Description
 *  Calls functions in Libgeda to process RC initialization files using
 *  previous function, x_rc_parse_gschem_error as an error handler. The
 *  function passes a pointer to an integer as the last parameter, and
 *  if that integer is incremented then a recoverable error occurred,
 *  and the call to process the RC file is repeated until either the
 *  integer is not incremented, meaning an error did not occur, or the
 *  number of attempts equals MAX_RC_ATTEMPTS, defined in idefines.h.
 *  Currently the limit is set to make 3 attempts, which applies to
 *  each type, gafrc, gschemrc, and rcfile, seperately, not in total.
 *
 * \param w_current  The current #GschemToplevel structure.
 * \param rcfile     Specific config file path, or NULL.
