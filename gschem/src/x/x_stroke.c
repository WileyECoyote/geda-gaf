 *  erased in this function.
 *
 *  It returns 1 if the stroke has been successfully evaluated as an
 *  action. It returns 0 if libstroke failed to transform the stroke
 *  or there is no action attached to the stroke.
 *
 *  \param [in] w_current The GschemToplevel object.
 *  \returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise, or -1 if error.
 *
 *  \note WEH: Revised eval-stroke so as to return the action rather
 *  than the stroke, we already knew what the stoke was because we
 *  passed it to eval-stroke. This new version evaluates the action
 *  rather than the stroke.
