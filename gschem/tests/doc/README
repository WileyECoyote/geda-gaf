The runtest.sh scripts extracts the value of the TEST= attribute
from each input file, which can have multible such attributes.
the value is the name of the shell script in the tests directory
to run. The relative file name of the inputs is passed as an
argument to the "value" script, aka ${src_dir}/inputs/file.sch

runtest.sh sets three environment varibles:

	1.) TEST_APP is the qualified path for gschem program

	2.) "TESTDIR" the "run" directory, ${build_dir}/run)

	3.) "regenerating" set if golden outputs are to be recreated

The "logs" directory is created if the directory does not exist.
The "logs" directory is emptied if the directory does exist.
The "logs" directory is not removed at completion.
The "run"  directory is created if the directory does not exist.
The "run"  directory is emptied before each script is ran.
The "run"  directory is removed at completion.
