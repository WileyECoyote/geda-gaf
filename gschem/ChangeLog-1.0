    * src/object/o_grips.c: Revise o_grips_inside_grip to explicitly request
      half_size in register and reorder operations to reduce unnecessary SP
      indexing, the compiler was probably going to do it anyways, even with
      optimization turned off. Revise o_grips_search_world to utilise gschem
      _toplevel_get_grips_half_size and add 3.5 to the w_size so that lines
      of the grip box are included as "inside" the grip.

2017-04-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * data/Makefile.am: Include gschem.applications in EXTRA_DIST.

   ** src/iface/i_zoom_world.c: Add double reciprocal_factor and perform
      1 / relative_zoom_factor division once in i_zoom_world, instead of
      4 times, adjust function wrap in module.

      strings, which are added as menu item if the the items do not already
      exist.

    * src/x/x_edit_text.c: Change string "Text String" to "Text Content".

    * src/x/x_toolbars.c: Reduce scope of toolbar variable in x_toolbars_
      restore_state.

    * src/object/o_place.c: Include buffers.png image in Doxygen output.

    * src/x/x_menus.c: Revise x_menu_setup_ui to store a copy of the raw
      menu name containing the buffers instead of a pointer to translated
      menu strings, revise comments. Replace strcmp with strncmp to check
      if the raw menu string is for a separator.

2017-04-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/base/gschem_main_window.c: Eliminate display variable and

    * po/zh_TW.po: Update Chinese traditional translations.

    * src/base/gschem.c: Use relative path to gschem.h.

    * src/x/x_autonumber.c: Replace geda_aligned_visible_label_new with
      geda_aligned_visible_bold_label_new in autonumber_create_dialog.

2017-04-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * include/gschem_idefines.h: Change MIN_GRIP_SIZE to 6 and MAX_GRIP_SIZE

    * src/base/gschem_toplevel.c: Add gschem_toplevel_set_grips_size as setter
      that strips the first bit so only even-numbered grips_size are stored.

    * src/base/gschem_main_window.c: Add function gschem_main_window_update.
      Add signals GEOMETRY_SAVE, GEOMETRY_RESTORE and RESTORE_POSITION with
      handlers gschem_main_window_geometry_save, gschem_main_window_restore_
      position, gschem_main_window_geometry_restore. Changing the size in
      "show" does not work, nor does changing the position in "map", hence
      seperate signals for size and position. In retropect, Gtk declaring
      gtk_window_move_resize static and not puplic was major "blowing it".

    * src/x/x_event.c: Remove storing pointer to w_current->drawable in
      x_event_configure (WTH?), move comparison and setting of old and new
      screen values before the check for page_current so that w_current is
      updated regardless of whether there is a active page or not.

    * src/x/x_window.c: Make x_window_reset_page_geometry non-static, remove
      saving and restoring of the main window geometry and call gschem_main_

      i_zoom_world_specify and i_zoom_world_box to use local pointer to
      the Page object obtained from geda_toplevel_get_current_page and
      pass a page argument to i_pan_world_general.

    * src/object/o_edit.c: Revise o_edit_find_text to pass the page to
      i_pan_world_general.

    * src/x/x_event.c Revise x_event_configure; eliminate save of the
      current page and use of geda_struct_page_goto, which is no longer
      required since the page is passed to i_pan_world_general, reference
      w_current->main_window->window instead of gtk_widget_get_toplevel
      since the toplevel is known.

    * src/x/x_window.csrc/x/x_window.c: Remove redundant reference to
      the same location in x_window_setup_page and rename variables.

2017-04-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      for toggles under the Options menu, use IDS_MENU_VIEW_MENU and IDS_MENU
      _VIEW_TOOLBARS to obtain items under the View/Menu and View/ Toolbar
      respectively so that tips for all menu items are toggled by IDS_MENU_

      7ceee94d143dd7da33a23633d61020de93a4b392:

      gschem: Refactor resnap logic to ensure correctness.

      Previously, there were code paths in the resnap logic which could lead
      to accessing uninitialised memory (reported on IRC by Gareth Edwards).
      The algorithm that chose whether to resnap or not also iterated over
      the selection twice, when once is actually enough.

      This patch changes the resnap logic to decide on snappability in one
      pass over the selection, ensuring that resnap only occurs if (1) there
      is at most one object selected that is not an attribute, and (2) all
      attribute objects are attached to the same object (whether it is
      selected or not).

    * Program Enhancement: New feature - Auto adjust Page Select Height
      Begin implementation of new feature to add an option to automatically
      adjust the height of the Page Select Dialog. This is a deviation from
      other dialogs which always retain and restore geometry. The PageSelect
      dialog can be launched with a single file opened, or many files so
      automatically adjusting the height for users would be a "nice" feature.
      This implementation only shrinks the dialog.

    * include/x_pagesel.h: Add define constants for PAGESEL_MIN_HEIGHT and
      PAGESEL_ROWS_THRESHOLD, add members renderer and row_height.

2016-05-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/base/gschem_toplevel.c: Add Doxygen comments for gschem_toplevel_
      move_page_down and gschem_toplevel_move_page_up.

    * src/x/x_pagesel.c: Add popup menu options "Move Up" and "Move Down" to
      allow user to reorder the pages, albeit sequentially, from the PageSel
      Dialog. Declare tree_view as a GtkTreeView instead of treeview widget.
      Revise pagesel_dnd_drag_receive to convert from widget to tree-view
      coordinates, which accounts for the header row. Add pagesel_callback_
      query_tooltip and set query_tooltip function to display full file names
      as tooltips when not displaying the full name in the tree.
      Added call to geda_tree_view_row_make_visible in pagesel_callback_
      selection_changed to ensure the current page is visible in the tree.
      Add and revise Doxygen comments.

    * src/x/x_window.c: Revise function x_window_update_title to not call
      gtk_window_set_title unless the new title string is different than the
      old string, one would think gtk would do this but gtk does not.

2016-05-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_zoom_world.c: Revise correct_aspect to use local double
      instead of referencing toplevel->page_current->coord_aspectratio
      multiple times.

    * src/x/x_event.c: Revised scrollbar callback functions x_event_hschanged
      and x_event_vschanged to not respond unless the slider changed value
      because the user moved the slider, otherwise the geometry of the page
      is already up-to-date. Updated Doxygen comments for both functions.

2016-05-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/base/gschem_main_window.c: Revise gschem_main_window_set_size to

      new feature: add state member scope_exact for case when scope_text does
      not contain a wild-card and distinish between plain test and text with
      digits. The new feature allows auto re-numbering of duplicated reference
      designators, miraculously leaving the first of the duplicates and resumes
      numbering using the next available number skipping those already assigned
      within the scope and makes it easier to auto-number plain text.

2016-05-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * scheme/gschem/deprecated.scm: Use copy-objects-hook instead of paste
      -objects-hook in copy-component-hook, this fixes "(add-hook! copy-
      component-hook auto-uref)" in  system-gschemrc.scm so components
      reference designators are automatically updated if this feature is
      enabled. This module should probably not be named "deprecated" since

      in function x_event_motion.

2016-05-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_event.c: Move call to i_status_update_action_state in

2016-04-11 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * include/gschem_main_window.h: Add function gschem_main_window_set_size.

    * src/base/gschem_main_window.c: Add function gschem_main_window_set_size
      because using only gtk_window_resize results in major delays in the
      children receiving the event, gdk is stalling propagation of the signal
      until the main loop goes idle and this has to be a blunder. On initial
      loading, the mostly like time to "resize" a window, the main thread is
      busy updating gadgets and then creating a new page object, loading and
      parsing schematic data, the test file was inverter.sch with over 350
      objects, aka GObjects, that had to be created and tweaking the page
      geometry to adjust the page to the size of the drawing canvas widget
      that still had not been updated! No Compiz either, major headache.
      The solution is to call gdk_window_process_updates which is integrated
      into the new function.

    * src/iface/i_pan_world.c: Revise debug prints to use __func__ string.

    * src/x/x_window.c: Adjust function line wrap, replace gtk_window_resize
      with gschem_main_window_set_size in x_window_restore_settings! Call
      i_window_set_viewport_size in x_window_setup after restore the window
      geometry so that screen_width and screen_height are promptly updated.
      Remove o_invalidate_all before x_window_open_page exit, does not seem
      to do anything. Add static function x_window_reset_page_geometry to
      set page boundaries based on content after opening a page and zoom
      to extents before returning to x_window_open_page. Revise and add
      some comments.

2016-04-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/base/gschem_page_history.c: Add some DOxygen comments, add

      comments in i_zoom_world_extents regarding the use of i_pan_warp_cursor,

      the pointer position relative to screen coordinates, which i_zoom_world_
      extents does not actually have, without triggering a motion and expose
      event. The problem is that repositioning the mouse cursor so abruptly is

    * include/x_dialog.h: Use relative path to ugly geda_dialog_controls
      so static analyzers can find, and hopefully decipher.

    * src/base/gschem_macro_widget.c: Change arguments to _class_init and
      _instance_init so as to remove cast in gschem_macro_widget_get_type

    * src/base/gschem_main_window.c: Change arguments to _class_init and
      _instance_init as was done for GschemMacroWidget.

    * src/base/gschem_page_view.c: Change arguments to _class_init and

      pspec and seperate from stack call;

    * src/base/gschem_status_bar.c: Change arguments to _class_init and
      _instance_init as was done for GschemMacroWidget.

    * src/x/x_compselect.c: Return result of comparison, not sure if I

    * src/x/x_multiattrib.c: Simplify multiattrib_update, eliminate g_string.

    * src/x/x_toolbars.c: Revert using file name in x_toolbars_restore_state,
      which was done while debugging test on Travis, since these filename
      included the path with user name and this would not be the same path
      on Travis work, consequently failing regression tests involving logs.

    * tests/IMAGE_DIFF: Revert using verbose safe mode, use quite, issue with
      testing on Travis resolved -nope, worker died with no messages.

    * tests/LOG_DIFF: Revert using verbose safe mode, use quite, issue with

      o_select_get_count, o_select_is_selection and o_select_motion, the
      later no so much. Reduce scope of variables, reformat, edit comments.

      by Vladimir Zhbanov, commit 43517aba280f91ee2ac1b6c67cd43cd496ca8aed:
      gschem: Fix close-page! in GUI.
      In gschem the close-page! procedure defined in the (geda page)
      module was overridden in order to carry out all necessary GUI clean
      up before exiting. However, this did not work due to a typo in its
      lowlevel Scheme function name, which caused segfaults by using it,
      e.g., as GUI macro. Now it segfaults not so often :)

      (64 bit) or libcairo 1.12.2-3 (32 bit), for example CAIRO_LINE_CAP_BUTT
      works in 1.13 but only on one end of a line with 1.12, and CAIRO_LINE_
      CAP_SQUARE yielded the correct result on only one end using both versions
      but was opposite end points between versions, only CAIRO_LINE_CAP_ROUND
      was consistently wrong, rounding only one of the line in both versions.

    * tests/inputs: Make text invisible because hieroglyphics are not drawn
      consistently on different machines, even when using the same font and
      this is justifiable since these tests are not about glyphs:

    * src/base/gschem_page_view.c: WEH: Modified per commit to Master branch
      by Vladimir Zhbanov, commit   8f473e5a75f7ed383128e6ed886e004270c0821f:
      gschem: Factor undo code out of gschem_page_view.c.

2015-12-03 Vladimir Zhbanov <vzhbanov@gmail.com>

    * src/base/gschem_page_view.c: Improve screen absolute size calculation.

    * docs/Makefile.am: WEH: Modified per commit to Master branch by Vladimir
      Zhbanov, commit 943109cf0979d26bcacd2e1fffb27f768d358d09: More accurate
      screen absolute object size calculations.

    * src/base/gschem_page_view.c: In some cases when page view screen width
      is small and viewport world width is great the gschem_page_view_SCREENabs
      function returned 0 due to division of integers was being done before
      multiplication by some (probably big) value. Now multiplication is done
      before division, which leads to more accurate calculation.

      Eliminated call to i_zoom_world in gschem_page_view_zoom_text.

      Eliminated w_current argument to gschem_page_view_pan_motion, pass mouse
      pan gain instead.

      Update Doxygen comments.

2015-12-02  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gschem/gschem-tools-menu.scm: Add comment gitg as convenience option
      for tools:gitclient.

    * src/globals.c: Relocate global variable from parsecmd.c.

    * src/base/gschem_parsecmd.c: Remove global variables from module, add
      not font family name commandline option, "-f, --font".

    * src/iface/i_vars.c: Revise string config error message and use qlog
      instead of fprintf. Set renderer font to command line specified value
      if present.

    * tests/.gitignore: Ignore the gEDA directories.

    * tests/runtest.sh: Redirect mv and ln errors so that the can be run
      repeated with the --debug option without all of the "file exist"
      error messages. Add export GUILE_AUTO_COMPILE=0 just in case it is
      not already in the system/bashrc file.

    * tests/IMAGE_DIFF: Utilize new command-line font option in gschem in
      an attempt to standardize test between machines.

2015-12-01  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * tests/runtest.sh: Major revisions to tests script in order to run the
      test from static build directory. A slightly different tactic is used
      compared to gnetlist or gsymcheck, which do not utilize icon. Rather
      than relying on environment variables or redirecting to an existing
      directory using a command-line option, the test attempts to create
      a mini-installation directory under the gEDA tests directory either
      by creating soft links to the relevant files or coping (scheme) the
      files. Both the GEDADATARC and GEDADATA are set to tests/gEDA using
      the fully qualified path.
      The guile path is appended using GUILE_LOAD_PATH as oppose to using
      the -g option, which still could be used by individual test procedures
      and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used for the path to libraries because gschem
      accesses more libraries.
      More work to create the "temporary installation" will likely be required
      as the tests for gschem expand but this seems to work for the current
      compilation.

2015-11-28  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/guile/g_rc.c: Revise parameters to RETURN_G_RC_MODE per changes
      to the macro in libgeda/defines.h

2015-11-26  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * tests/inputs/bus_ripper_1.sch: Rename busses.sch to bus_ripper_1.sch
      and use as input for TEST=IMAGE_DIFF.

    * src/iface/i_status.c: Revise function i_status_idle_update_sensitivities
      to enable "attach attribute" in menu is any object and test selected not
      just complexes in function.

2015-11-25  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * tests/TEST_FUNCS: Add file for common routines for test modules.

    * tests/IMAGE_DIFF: Include TEST_FUNCS and use compare_image instead of
      just a diff.

    * tests/runtest.sh: Add ERRDIR, include TEST_FUNCS, remove function vecho,
      which was relocated to TEST_FUNCS.

2015-11-25  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * tests/LOG_DIFF: Rename log files in the local log directory to match
      the name of the test file.

2015-11-23  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_window.c: Iconize the main window until after the size and
      position have been restored; added gtk_window_iconify in function
      x_window_create_main right before gtk_widget_show and then call
      gtk_window_deiconify before exiting x_window_restore_settings.

    * docs/gschem.1.in: Document new command-line option "-z, --minimized"

    * docs/images/buffers.sch: Rename file gschem_buffers.sch to buffers.sch
      and relocated from examples to docs/images. Although the diagram was a
      good example of diagramming in gschem, the content relates to program
      documentation and did not fit "examples".

    * examples: Minor tweeks, update  diode-1.sym and in-1.sym version.

    * src/base/gschem_parsecmd.c: Add command-line option "-z, --minimized"
      and public varible iconify_main_window.

    * src/base/gschem.c: Revise function gschem to not call x_console_open
      if iconify_main_window is set.

    * src/x/x_window.c: Revise function x_window_restore_settings to not call
      gtk_window_deiconify if iconify_main_window is set. This leaves the
      main window minimized on the task bar and make things a bit less flashy
      when running tests.

    * tests/LOG_DIFF: Add ANSI escape sequence for red and green and output
      colorized pass/fail results.

    * tests/inputs/missing_symbols.sch: Rename missing.sch missing_symbols.sch.

    * tests/inputs/versionsym?.sch: Add TEST=LOG_DIFF attribute, clean-up and
      relocate to files from the sort subdirectory.

    * tests/runtest.sh: Add -d, --debug option, when enabled the
      run directory is not emptied in between each test not removed
      when testing is complete. Added removing of *~ backup files
      from the input diectory when batch processing because these
      were reported as failures, added comments.

    * tests/IMAGE_DIFF: Add new script, similar to LOG_DIFF, but tweaked for
      image files. Use image.scm script to insure uniform geometry, but is
      still a skeleton; using DIFF for image comparison will no doubt be to
      sensitive, need something more image oriented.

2015-11-22  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Improve BUILD Integrity.

    * tests/: Revamp directory structure and setup foundation for a tests system
      for gschem. Only completes one test so far, but its a start.

    * tests/gafrc: Replace file, disable log-time to facilitate comparing of log
      data, set log-directory to local folder for tests.

    * tests/Makefile.am: Include Makefile_insert files to alleivate having to
      modify configure.ac in order to add or remove tests.

    * tests/Makefile_insert: This is a special file for the files in inputs/
      subdirectory but can not be in the subdirectory because all contents of
      the inputs is considered to be a input for test. Could workaround this
      but is probably the better to leave in the tests folder than to add
      some like "TEST=nop" to the include file.

    * tests/IMAGE_DIFF: New file is place holdering for a script to capture
      and compare images during gschem tests.

    * tests/LOG_DIFF: New file is shell a script to compare log file data
      during gschem tests.

    * doc/tests.sch: A new schematic file that uses new flow chart symbols,
      is suppose to represent the code flow for new tests systems, at least
      as implemented in bash.

2015-11-21  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/guile/g_funcs.c Scheme API function gschem-exit has been enhanced
      to allow routine to optionally pass an exit code.

    * src/x/x_toolbars.c: Switch left "edit" toolbar to temporary GSCHEM_
      TOOLBAR_BUTTON macro.

    * tests/gafrc: Replace current-working-directory with cwd and getenv "PWD"
      with getcwd, that later so that the the sch files requiring other local
      files can be opened in a GUI file manager, in which case the environment
      PWD typically points to the HOME directory and not the directory where
      the sch files are located.

        * Allow horizontal scrollbar for Value textview to prevent dialog
          window to expand more than display size.

    * src/x/x_multiattrib.c: Implmentented enhanchments per commit reference
      above.

2015-11-20  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

2015-11-19  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Revamp i_cmd_do_print; scope variables since all
      are used in the else clause of first conditional, remove unnecessary
      initialization of variables, utilize f_get_filename_ext and replace
      g_str_has_suffix with ordinary strncmp, remove strlen("literal") and
      hard code the constant = 4, utilize SCHEMATIC_FILE_DOT_SUFFIX and add
      clause to also check for SYMBOL_FILE_DOT_SUFFIX and remove if found,
      move freeing of ps_filename inside the else.

    * src/guile/g_funcs.c: Add functions g_funcs_common_image, g_funcs_bmp_image,
       g_funcs_jpeg_image, and g_funcs_tiff_image.

    * src/guile/g_register.c: register functions g_funcs_bmp_image g_funcs_
      jpeg_image, and g_funcs_tiff_image.

    * tests/gafrc:  Remove quotes from function "current-working-directory"

    * multiline1.sch: Rename file multiline -> multiline1

    * oldsym1.sym: Rename file oldsym -> oldsym1

    * src/guile/g_rc.c: Revise error messages in check_and_convert_scm_integer
      because non-RC Scheme code can invoke routines within the module and the
      messages were mis-leading. Replace defined constants for printing with
      newly defined constants for image, see above.

    * tests/agile-vfo-block_1.sch: Replace spdt.sym with switch_spst-1.sym.

    * tests/all_1.sch: Capiltized LM, AM and IDT in symbol names.

2015-11-17  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      to a pointer to const char.

    * src/base/gschem_parsecmd.c: Change command line option "L" to "g" and
      add long option "guile" for passing extra path to search on start-up.

    * src/x/x_console.c: Add "gschem" to modified messages in function log_
      message if verbose mode.

    * src/x/x_image.c: Added log message in function x_image_write_eps for

      with "Error".

    * src/x/x_image.c: Free "filetype" in function x_image_setup instead of
      x_image_lowlevel because this results in an error when x_image_lowlevel
      is called from function g_funcs_png_image. Change definition for x_image
      _lowlevelfiletype to make 5th argument, filetype, const char pointer.

    * src/x/x_print.c: Replace "Gtk" macro GetComboBoxActive with function
      geda_combo_box_get_active to eliminate Gtk noise.

2015-11-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * docs/gschem.1.in: Add missing option -a and -L and add missing paragraph
      breaks before the title-block and undo dir sections.

    * include/gschem_globals.h: Rename file globals.h->gschem_globals.h
      because Doxygen tags reference libgeda, which also has a globals.h
      and this confuses Doxygen (but not the compiler).

    * include/gschem.h: Update file name for gschem_globals.h and resequenced
      to include gschem_globals earlier, #2 (not that this matters, but is
      alphabetical).

    * src/base/gschem.c:Replace q_log_message with u_log_vmessage for logging
      scheme initialization file.

    * src/base/gschem_parsecmd.c: Removed errent colon after the GETOPT_OPTIONS
      "p", the place option does not take an argument and remove extra blank
      line from end of file.

2015-11-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * include/gschem_page_view.h: Change first argument gschem_page_view_pan_
      start from GschemPageView to GschemToplevel.

    * src/base/gschem_page_view.c: include math.h, update first argument to
      gschem_page_view_pan_start function. Revise function gschem_page_view_
      SCREENabs to eliminate double i, changing rint to lrint.

    * src/object/o_break.c: Conditionally compile to use hypot instead of
      sqrt in funtion o_break_path.

    * src/object/o_extend.c: Conditionally compile to use hypot instead of
      sqrt in funtions o_extend_can_path_bound and o_extend_can_circle_bound.

      s_place_free_place_list in function i_callback_cancel.

    * src/object/o_buffer.c: Replace s_object_release_objects, set NULL and
      o_list_copy_all with s_place_set_place_list in o_buffer_paste_start().

    * src/object/o_move.c: Call s_place_free_place_list instead of if ->list,
      release and set list NULL in function o_move_cancel.

    * src/object/o_place.c: Call s_place_get_place_list to actually get the
      list to check the length in function o_place_start.

    * src/object/o_text.c: Use s_place_free_place_list to simply function
      o_text_prepare_place, and use macro, ugh, Current_PlaceList.

2015-11-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_toolbars.c: Convert toggle-visibilty, view-show-hidden and

    * include/gschem_toplevel.h: Return boolean from gschem_toplevel_set
      _current_page, true if all is well.

    * src/base/gschem_toplevel.c: Revise gschem_toplevel_set_current_page
      so as to not allow the current page to be NULL, like libgeda does,
      A TRUE return assures w_current, toplevel and page are all valid
      pointers

    * src/x/x_window.c: Call gschem_toplevel_set_current_page in
      x_window_set_current_page and revise to utilize returned value,
      eliminating the toplevel variable.

2015-10-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_compselect.c: Revise function x_compselect_callback_response
      to use s_place_free_place_list instead of manually check place_list.

    * include/i_command.h: Add page-previous and page-next.

    * src/x/x_toolbars.c: Add buttons for page-previous and page-next.

    * Page Prev/Next not working yet (accidentally committed action handlers
      in i_Command.c so just add to date), right now back/forward does
      the same as up/down.

2015-10-30 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_move.c: Zero the smaller difference in o_move_end
      if constraining, previously this was done in event handlers but
      longer.

    * src/object/o_place.c:: Zero the smaller difference in o_move_end
      if containing.

    * src/x/x_menus.c: Set the "show-image" in x_menu_setup_popup so the
      state of the icon matches the setting at startup. Add strings for
      tool-tips in popup_items structure, the tool-tips worked but did not
      have strings defined.

2015-10-29 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * include/gschem_idefines.h: Change default auto save interval to
      3 minutes.

      toplevel to function:

        * gschem_page_view_invalidate_object
        * gschem_page_view_invalidate_screen_rect
        * gschem_page_view_invalidate_world_rect

    * src/base/gschem_page_view.c: Updated module from master branch and
      revise to compile, not completely implemented.

    * src/base/gschem_toplevel.c: Revise gschem_toplevel_get_current_page
      to use geda_toplevel_get_current_page, add function gschem_toplevel_
      set_current_page.

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Revise i_cmd_do_page_last to use accessor
      geda_toplevel_get_current_page and macro geda_toplevel_get_pages.
      Revise i_cmd_do_page_up to use geda_toplevel_get_current_page and
      geda_toplevel_get_page_up,i_cmd_do_page_down to use geda_toplevel_
      get_current_page and geda_toplevel_get_page_down.

    * src/x/x_window.c: Reverse arguments for x_window_create_drawing_area,
      looked weird.

2015-10-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      derived from GtkEntry, using geda_entry_new_with_max_length
      and remove calls to gtk_entry_set_max_length in functions
      x_dialog_edit_slot.

2015-10-18 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_settings_dialog.c: Implement work around in function
      setup_font_name_combo for gtk/pango BUG interpreting ordinary
      text data as Pango markup. Attempts to escape the ampersands
      did suppress the warnings, unfortunately the escape sequence
      is left in the text and is displayed in the combo box. Yet
      another 6 hours of my life lost to Gtk.

      Vladimir Zhbanov, commit  af58712b1c5ab2645b28613e141b5aa57792077e:

      On Windows system, guile post-2.0.11 prepends a %load-path directory
      to the path that is already built using build-path for some reason,
      which leads to strange names, e.g. "d:\usr\share\geda\d:/usr/share/
      gEDA/gschem-colormap-darkbg", in several case, which, in turn, breaks
      loading of rc files by gschem. Using 'primitive-load' instead of
      'load' solves this.

2015-08-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_color.c: Removed  unused functions: x_color_get_darkcolor and

    * Code Enhancement: Fix g_rc_gschem_version.

    * src/guile/g_rc.c: WEH: Modified per commit to Master branch by Vladimir
      Zhbanov, commit 1bc39de0a196a97e3261f1d22f63ebde2cf864da:

      Guile since version 1.9.6 does not check source properties of evaluated
      files for some reason returning just #f for them. So the return value of
      g_rc_rc_filename() is always #f when it checks rc_filename. Obviously,
      we cannot use this value in scm_to_utf8_string(). This situation appears
      only if wrong/old gschem-version value is set in a rc file. This patch
      checks the returned value and sets rc_filename to "unknown" if guile
      could not determine it.

2015-08-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      Zhbanov, commit 7a209a977320a97f93e2b2b2e4f5bc0230372d33:

      Schematics exported in PDF format using File->Write image had inappropriate
      large scale, which led to inadequate behaviour of some PDF viewers, since
      some of them cannot show documents after exceeding some size, others do it
      very slowly. The default scale has been changed and now 1000 gschem points
      represent 1 inch (72 Adobe points) in output document.

      helps 3 icons help-faq, keyboard-shortcuts, and web-browser and signal
      is emitted non-stop while mouse is moving. Need to replace the 3 icons
      and then do away with connecting to notify::stock-id signal.

2015-04-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * etc/system-gschemrc.scm: Change primary assignment key for attributes-
      find-text from "B <Shift>F" to "B F". Update icon names for actions

      png files existed, but could not locate even an older svg with the stupid
      little two Ts, so had to recreate. I think icons came out a little better,
      not quite so fugly, renamed all theme icons with gschem prefix.

2015-04-11 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/guile/g_keys.c: Rename function g_keys_to_list_store to

2015-04-09 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: New Feature

  ** src/x/x_compselect.c: Initial focus on the Component Dialog is the component
     tree view and this seems reasonable but some might prefer to have the filter
     entry receive the initial focus. Add GtkWidget style property focus-filter
     and function compselect_style_set so users can set preference in gschem-gtkrc.

2015-04-09 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Incomplete implementation

   ** gschem_status_bar.c: The status bar widget was previously given a "height"
      property but there was no means to implement. Add GtkWidget style property
      function gschem_status_bar_style_set and now the height of the status bar
      can be set in the gschem-gtkrc file.

2015-04-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Incorrect behavior

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Revise function i_cmd_do_attach to set which_object
      NULL before conditionally setting, add variable for GList pointer, next so
      the both objects, the selection, are passed to o_attrib_attach_list_2_object.
      (That was the whole point to the previous revisions.)

2015-04-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Improve Stability

    * include/x_compselect.h: Add pointer variable for filter_hbox and boolean
      rescan_lib in dialog data structure.

    * src/x/x_compselect.c: Clean code, revise function compselect_refresh_tree
      _views to used more localized variables and check flag rescan_lib and call
      s_clib_refresh if set; could eliminate variables but I think would reduce
      readability. The new scheme allows compselect_refresh_tree_views to read
      any selection in the tree "before" the the library is refreshed, the only
      reason the old scheme worked at all was because s_clib_refresh lost the
      race with compselect_refresh_tree_views. Adding wait-states to loader did
      fix the problem but only used as diagnostics, another option considered was
      to do away with the implanted CLibSymbol and just put the string in the
      tree, this would likely speed up the dialog is probably a better long term
      solution but moving the call to s_clib_refresh is relatively easy fix and
      should be benign. Also saved pointer to the "filter" area in structure to
      disable sorting switches in one fell swoop, whilst the refresh is on going.

2015-04-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Revise display-color-map and outline-color-map list corresponding to

    * Code Enhancement: Improve Stability

    * src/x/x_menus.c: Revise function x_menu_setup_ui, adding subfunctions;
      create_file_menu and create_View_menu, which are used to help build a basic
      menu in the event there was an error while processing system-gschemrc.scm,
      and this does commonly occurs with gschem.

2015-04-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Improve Stability

    * src/iface/i_status.c: Add conditional in i_status_idle_update_sensitivities

      implemented.

2015-04-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Improve Stability

    * src/x/x_compselect.c: Revise function compselect_callback_refresh_views
      to check iter.stamp when checking whether iters are valid, and check if
      valid before passing to gtk_tree_model_iter_parent and geda_tree_view_
      row_make_visible.

2015-04-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

2015-04-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: New Feature.

    * src/x/x_edit_cprop.c: Revised function x_dialog_ep_revise_symbol _attribs
      to retrieve and check the symbol file name from the dialog and update the
      file name if the string has changed. This allows user to rename a symbol
      file without using "Save As", except the file is not saved.

2015-04-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: BUG Fix.

    * src/x/x_edit_pin.c: Fix seg-fault during auto-number pins when pins do

    * object/o_invalidate.c: Rename function o_invalidate_glist to
      o_invalidate_list.

2015-03-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * include/i_command.h: Switch do_down_symbol from USE_WORKER_THREAD
      to USE_MAIN_LOOP to fix seg faults when symbol is in local branch
      directory. This needs to be investigated more but seems to fix the
      problem for now, fault occurs in Scheme g_read_scheme_file__post_
      handler, likely port related issue.

2015-03-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/base/gschem.c: Revert not opening a blank document when
      i_sessions_open_session returns false in function load_documents().
      Error recovery in the i_sessions module is low-level and effective
      for issues with in the session files. At program startup when there
      is no document open and the user specifies a non-existence session
      on the command line, i_session_load_session does not get called so
      the low-level recovery does not get an opprotunity to handle.
      Opening a blank document load_documents() handles these situations.

2015-03-30 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Revert not calling o_undo_savestate in
      do_down_symbol, the first change made in the child symbol can
      not be undone.

      o_edit_objects in function x_event_button_pressed; breaks the SAE.

    * src//*.c: WEH: Modified per commit to Master branch by Vladimir
      See commit d219c401f782a3104aed533419fd3a2cdb305fe2 (older) to
      (re) implement canceling with third button:

    * etc/system-gschemrc.scm: Add keyword; third-button-cancel

    * etc/user-gschemrc.scm: Add keyword; third-button-cancel

    * include/gschem_toplevel.h: Add int third_button_cancel

    * include/i_vars.h: Add extern for int default_third_button_cancel

    * include/prototype.h: Declare g_rc_third_button_cancel.

    * src/base/gschem_toplevel.c: Fix indentation (not related to other stuff).

    * src/guile/g_rc.c: Add function g_rc_third_button_cancel.

    * src/guile/g_register.c: register "third-button-cancel".

    * src/iface/i_vars.c: Configure w_current->third_button_cancel.

    * src/x/x_event.c:Remove/comment-out i_status_set_state in case SELECT
      in function x_event_button_pressed. Not exactly the same as recent
      modifications to master branch, just did not seem be useful. Added
      check for third_button_cancel option in 3 button press event handler
      but is tweaked from Vladimir version, since the previous alterations
      were also tweaked to allow the third button to cancel in not inside
      an action, now the third button can cancel both in and out side of
      actions, if the SHIFT key is not down, indicated the user wants to
      pan but not cancel, which also allows panning inside of actions.

2015-03-30 Vladimir Zhbanov <vzhbanov@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_status.c: WEH: Modified per commit to Master branch by
      Vladimir See commit 15f714362a1f46c41ccdce559b832ac34999d13c. The
      change is to return a different string for the SBOX states, prior
      code returned the same string for SBOX, GRIPS, and SELECT states.

    * src/object/o_grips.c: Move enumerated GRIPS from somewhere near
      the bottom to position 3, not sure how GRIPS got so far down the
      list.

2015-03-30 Vladimir Zhbanov <vzhbanov@gmail.com>

    * src//*.c: WEH: Modified per commit to Master branch by Vladimir

      visual feedback to the used indication an action is in progress. I
      tweeked Vladimir commit slightly; use macros i_status_action_start
      and i_status_action_stop instead of using seperate functions.

    * src/base/gschem_toplevel.c: Add resetter gschem_toplevel_free_primary
      and ensure primary_selection is free in finializer.

    * src/iface/i_callbacks.c: Call gschem_toplevel_free_primary in cancel
      function.

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Added functions

            * i_cmd_do_draw_after   (activates o_select_connect_selector)
            * i_cmd_do_draw_before  (activates o_select_connect_selector)
            * i_cmd_do_draw_first
            * i_cmd_do_draw_last

    * src/object/o_page.c: New module to implement the Draw-Order operations,
      which of course are not the actual draw order, changes the order of
      objects in the page list. This is useful for symbol files when objects
      were not drawn in the proper order. Previously one would restore to
      editing the file with a text editor, not good.

2015-03-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Add means for nouns verb nouns.

    * src/object/o_select.c; Add static functions o_select_press_butt,
      o_select_release_butt, and o_select_enable_events, with saftey
      out o_select_cancel_events and feature function o_select_connect
      _selector. The scheme allow caller to pass a "call after" function
     and bypasses normal button event handling to allow user to select
     or deselect objects using the normal methods and calls the passed
     function when the user "right-clicks" and this facilitate routines
     that have already collected a selection to ask for a second second
     set to as to perform and operation on both sets of objects.

2015-03-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Simplify Coding for Select Event

    * src/object/o_select.c: Remove call to o_grips_start and setting of
      the state (i_status_set_state) function in o_select_end.

    * src/x/x_event.c: Add call to i_status_set_state(SELECT) after calling
      o_select_end in x_event_button_released, there is no reason to impose
      that o_select_end should change the event states.

2015-03-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Use Accessors in general functions

    * src/object/o_select.c: Revise o_select_is_selection and
      o_select_get_count to use gschem_toplevel_get_current_page.

2015-03-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Remove superfurous code

    * iface/i_command.c: Remove use of NOT_NULL macro in i_cmd_do_close
      i_cmd_do_redo and i_cmd_do_page_revert, the test for w_current is
      included by the BEGIN_W_COMMAND macro.

2015-03-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_dialog.c: REvise/update Doxygen comments, removing the word
      "Functions" from group titles for:

            Help-About-Dialog
            Arc-Edit-Dialog
            Fill-Type-Dialog
            Line-Type-Dialog
            Edit-Slots-Dialog
            Find-Text-Dialog
            Edit-Hide-Text-Dialog
            Show-Text-Dialog
            Text-Input-Dialog
            Translate-Dialog
            Hotkeys-Dialog
            Confirm-Exit-Dialog
            Symbol-Changed-Dialog
            Invalid-Dialog
            Confirmation-Dialog (and make plural)
            File-Select-File-Dialog
            Message-Dialogs Message (and make plural)

      Associated Snap-Size-Dialog and Text-Size-Dialog with the Settings-Dialogs
      group. Change Editing-Dialogs X-Dialogs to "Editing Schematics" instead of
      "Editing Object Properties"

2015-03-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_autonumber.c: Revise DOxygen comment, include references to
      image of dialog, this seems to be less then idea for this module, but
      okay for other modules.

    * src/x/x_compselect.c: Revise DOxygen comment, include references to
      image of dialog and new group Component-Select-Dialog.

    * src/x/x_console.c: Revise DOxygen comment, include references to images
      of dialog and new group Console-Dialog-Implementation referencing both
      Console-Dialog and Systemic-Dialogs, and group Console-Dialog-Class,
      referencing only parent group Console-Dialog, resequenced out of order
      function x_log_message and add a separate DOxygen group Logging-Utilities
      for functions q_log_message and v_log_message since neither is directly
      associated with the dialog.

    * Applied similar scheme to add a module group and references to dialog
      images for modules:

            * src/x/x_fileselect.c
            * src/x/x_image.c
            * src/x/x_multiattrib.c
            * src/x/x_pagesel.c

    * Revised existing Doxygen group to include references to dialog images for
      modules:

            * src/x/x_sessions.c
            * src/x/x_settings_dialog.c

2015-03-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * include/x_compselect.h: Add DOxygen group Component-Dialog in header
      file with references to images of the Console dialog.

    * include/x_console.h: Add DOxygen group Console-Dialog in header file
      with references to images of the Console dialog.

    * include/x_dialog.h: Add DOxygen group Settings-Dialogs in header file.

2015-03-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Improve Source Code Documentation

    * docs/dialogs: Add seperate subdirectory for static png images of dialog
      boxes (to be) referenced in source documentation. On first go-around the
      images were added to the /images subdirectory and a subsequent cleaning
      deleting all of the dialog images, docs/images/Makefile.am. The cleaning
      scheme wipes all pngs and pdf file, I like but had to capture all of the
      dialogs again, crap.

    * Add image files:

            * dialogs/array_dialog.png
            * dialogs/auto_number_dialog.png
            * dialogs/component_select_dialog.png
            * dialogs/console_dialog.png
            * dialogs/fileselect_dialog.png
            * dialogs/image_chooser_dialog.png
            * dialogs/manage_sessions_dialog.png
            * dialogs/multiattrib_dialog.png
            * dialogs/page_man_dialog.png
            * dialogs/preferences_dialog.png
            * dialogs/write_image_dialog.png

    * dialogs/Makefile: Add static MakeFile.

    * docs/gschem.dox: Revise DOxygen configuration file to include the files
      listed above for both HTML and Latex builds.

2015-03-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Improve Source Code Documentation

    * src/object/o_break.c: Insert references to images for module; break.png
      .png and break_box.png.

    * src/object/o_extend.c:Insert references to images for module; projections
      and projections2.png.

    * src/x/x_edit_array.c: Add second subgroup; Create-Array-Dialog and insert
      references to images for module; array_dialog.png for the first group;
      Array-Dialogs. The double grouping results in the images showing before
      other stuff in the module in the source documentation, looks better. If
      only it was so painful to do this with DOxygen.

2015-03-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Improve Source Code Documentation

    * src/object/o_edit.c: Add documentation group Editing-Operations (as the
      whole module).

    * src/object/o_break.c: Add entire o_break module as documentation group
      Break-Operations as subgroup of Editing-Operations.

    * src/object/o_copy.c: Add entire o_copy module as documentation group
      Copy-Operations as subgroup of Editing-Operations.

    * src/object/o_extend.c: Add entire o_extend module as documentation group
      Extend-Operations as subgroup of Editing-Operations.

    * src/object/o_move.c: Add entire o_move module as documentation group
      Move-Operations as subgroup of Editing-Operations.

    * src/object/o_place.c: Add entire o_place module as documentation group
      Place-Operations as subgroup of Editing-Operations.

    * src/object/o_slot.c: Add entire o_slot module as documentation group
      Slot-Operations as subgroup of Editing-Operations.

2015-03-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * images/Makefile.am: New file to generate image from schematics that were
      created for Doxygen documention. Added the following schematics for
      documentation:

            * docs/images/array_dialog.sch
            * docs/images/break.sch
            * docs/images/break_box.sch
            * docs/images/projections.sch
            * docs/images/projections2.sch

2015-03-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * examples/IEC417.sch: Update symbol arrow.sym (new version use round caps)

    * examples/filter_1.sch: Cleanup drawing, assign refdes to CONN1, T1, and
      diodes.

    * examples/stack_1.sch: Updated symbol name with upper case: AM9128-1.sym

    * examples/gschem_buffers.sch: Updated symbol for 741 opamp

    * examples/cmos-nand.sch: Updated symbols, cleanup hidden attributes

    * examples/cmos-nand.sch: Updated symbols, cleanup hidden attributes

    * examples/cmos-invert.sch: Updated symbols, cleanup hidden attributes

2015-03-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * New Feature: Create arrays of Objects;

    * src/x/x_array.c: New module to implement array operations. The
      Create Array Dialog is unique in that helper over-ride event handlers
      and thus x_event. The Create Array Dialog has buttons to Select and
      Deselect objects, as well as buttons for X, Y or XY offset distances.
      The normal event handlers are restored once callbacks have completed
      associated task. The button event schemes allows normal selection
      keys, zooming, panning, etc..., while selecting objects.

    * include/x_dialog.h: Add structure st_array_data.

2015-03-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Remove redundent code.

    * src/object/o_edit.c: Revert use of functions gschem_toplevel_get_geda_
      toplevel and gschem_toplevel_get_current_page in functions o_edit_lock
      and o_edit_unlock, is redundent code since it was established that a
      selection existed so pointers to toplevel and current page must have
      been valid.

2015-03-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Ensure consistence messages, reduce string space.

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Add function action_err and macros NO_ACTION and
      BEGIN_NO_ACTION. Implement BEGIN_NO_ACTION in functions:

            * i_cmd_do_cut_clip
            * i_cmd_do_offset
            * i_cmd_do_attach
            * i_cmd_do_detach
            * i_cmd_do_home_attributes
            * i_cmd_do_show_value
            * i_cmd_do_show_name
            * i_cmd_do_show_both
            * i_cmd_do_toggle_visibility

      This insures that was user is told can not be done in an action is also
      what the status lines states will be done when repeating last operation.

2015-03-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Allow existing feature while in actions.

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Remove check for inside_action from function
      i_cmd_do_show_nets. Does not seem to interfer and could be usefull
      feature.

2015-03-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Improve code organization.

    * src/iface/i_vars.c: Remove freeing default_component_select_attrlist
      in function i_vars_freenames, free during object destruction instead.

    * src/base/gschem_toplevel.c: Free the default_component_select_attrlist
      in gschem_toplevel_finalize.

2015-03-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Remove redundent code.

    * src/object/o_copy.c: Eliminate declaration and setting of the same
      variable in both branches of the same conditional.

2015-03-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * New Feature: Complete Offset Implementation;

    * src/object/o_edit.c: Completed the "non-hot" offset operation, which
      offsets selection a given distance, saving in toplevel as offset, and
      uses new mode ENDOFFSET, but does not end per se. Only in one case in
      x_event to trigger on mouse down, only sets inside-action in mouse up
      so that mouse 3 down will cancel the command. Need to figure out how
      to do with other events, is God awful mess since going to new "MODE"
      flags. Anyways, hot offset now unconditionally moves selection to new
      objects and relocates mouse pointer so that repeatedly pressing "E O"
      keeps creating new copies in the same direction with the same offset.
      The non-hot version also move the selection to the new objects if the
      shift key is held down, but does not move the pointer position, just
      keep offsetting to whichever side user is pointing until right click.

2015-03-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Source Code Organization

    * src/iface/i_window.c: Relocate function x_window_set_cursor and
      x_window_set_grid_type to i_window modules as i_window_set_cursor
      and i_window_set_grid_type to downsize x_window a bit and I think
      i_windows is better fit for this two functions.

2015-03-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * New Feature: Introduce action Offset; selected objects are copied to
      to the current point postion.

    * src/object/o_edit.c: Implement new "offset" feature; selected objects

2015-03-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * iface/i_window.c: Add function i_window_revert_page; a slightly more
      sophisticated reloader. Function reloads the page contents from file
      rather than destroying page object and reloading new page and this
      allows revert to stay in the same index position - a major annoyance
      with the old routines, also saves undo state and can recovery the
      current page if the file can not be reloaded and does not request
      confirmation to reload an unmodified page, uses i_event_block_handler
      to hide blank page when file can not be reloaded and speeds up reloads.

2015-03-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Use Accessors functions

    * src/object/o_edit.c: Modify functions o_edit_lock and o_edit_unlock to
      use gschem_toplevel_get_geda_toplevel and gschem_toplevel_get_current_
      page. General cleaning and update DOxygen comments.

2015-03-19 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Add Accessors functions

    * src/base/gschem_toplevel.c: Add functions gschem_toplevel_get_current
      _page and gschem_toplevel_get_geda_toplevel.

2015-03-19 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Consolidate Page Closing

    * include/i_command.h: Change i_cmd_do_page_close to worker thread.

    * src/iface/i_window.c: Add function i_window_close_page as common
      function for both i_cmd_do_file_close and i_cmd_do_page_close. Call
      hook before closing the page.  This allow a reference to be held on
      the page and probably makes more sense to tell SCM the page is going
      to close as opose to the page has already been closed.

    * iface/i_command.c: Revise functions i_cmd_do_file_close and
      i_cmd_do_page_close to call i_window_close_page.

2015-03-19 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Make starting Edit-Text Dialog more flexible.

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Revised function i_cmd_do_edit_text to launch
      the text dialog if at least one text object is selected, previous the
      dialog would not open unless o_select_return_first_object returned a
      text object, which was annoying because if there were several items,
      and one was text, the dialog might or might not launch, depending on
      the order of the text in the selection.

2015-03-18 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Fix startup errors when sessions on command line fails
      to successfully open any documents.

    * src/base/gschem.c: Add comment for non-expanded wild-card, removed
      calling x_window_open_page if session returns error, error recovery
      is handled in the module, revised error message for session load fail.

    * src/iface/i_sessions.c: Revised function i_session_load_session to
      request loading a blank document if no files were opened, and check
      and report relative file names in a session file. If a blank document
      is required for recovery then sleep for one second to ensure a page is
      loaded, even if blank, before x_dialog_symbol_changed is called, error
      recovery only so a delay is acceptable.

    * src/x/x_dialog.c: Revised function x_dialog_symbol_changed to check if
      current page is NULL, in case file loading/page setup is delayed due to
      errors.

2015-03-17 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Fix Component No-Place BUG

    * src/x/x_compselect.c: There seems no go reason to call o_redraw_
      cleanstates in close response, this cancels Move, which undoes the
      last operation before launching the component select dialog if the
      user does not actually attempt to place anything.

2015-03-17 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Fix Hook BUG

    * src/guile/g_hook.c: If the third time is a charm, whats the forth?
      seg-faulting in g_hook_idle_run_object_list, contents of list was
      invalid. Revised function g_hook_run_object_list to make a copy of
      the list AND add a reference on each object. Should have done this
      to start with - a reference is held on single objects and pages, but
      did not do contents of list. Done now.
      During diagnostics, tasks were being spawned before the previous task
      had completed - the code was "flowing" fast, this happened regularly
      with list. Oddly, this did not seem to cause a problem, perhaps this
      is because there is no actual hook. Added a Mutex lock on g_hook_run_
      idle_callback with g_hook_run_idle_notify unlocking so the main loop
      will iterate and new hooks will not be processed until the previous
      has completed.

2015-03-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Improve Logistics

    * Move calling of changed page hook from action handlers to interface
      updater.

    * src/iface/i_command.c Remove calling page hook in i_cmd_do_page_prev
      i_cmd_do_page_next.

    * src/iface/i_window.c: Notify change page hook in i_window_on_page_
      changed and update Doxygen comment.

2015-03-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Reorganize code structure, add new module

    * src/iface/i_event.c: New module with code to setup event handlers
      from the x_window module. Moved structure outside of function and
      made static. Added member block. Add four new functions:

            * i_event_block_buttons
            * i_event_unblock_buttons
            * i_event_block_handler
            * i_event_unblock_handler

      Seems like these could in handy.

2015-03-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Use consistence naming for enumerated types.

    * include/globals.h: Rename EFL_SELECTION_MODE (I can not remember
      what the L was for) to EID_SELECTION_MODE and removed prefix from
      members. The prefixes were probably a good thing, but the other
      EID_xx enumerators do not have EID_, all should be ID_ will need
      to fix someday but low priority.

    * src/object/o_find.c: Update EID_SELECTION_MODE names in functions
      o_find_is_object_hit and o_find_object.

2015-03-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Add Selection Getter to GschemDialog

    * src/base/gschem_dialog.c: Add function gschem_dialog_get_selected.

2015-03-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Fix Systemic Logistical Flaw

    * Do not disconnect Selection Tracker when dialog Unmaped

    * src/base/gschem_dialog.c: Relocated disconnection of the selection
      tracker from unmap_handler to gschem_dialog_finalize.

2015-03-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Fix Systemic Logistical Flaw

    * Do not assume that all that is placed should be undone

    * src/object/o_copy.c: Add calling o_undo_savestate after calling
      o_place_end in functions; o_copy_end and o_undo_savestate.

    * src/object/o_place.c: Remove o_undo_savestate from o_place_end,
      Add calling o_undo_savestate after calling o_place_end in functions;
      o_place_component_end, o_place_text_end, and o_place_paste_end.

    * src/x/x_coord.c: Add calling o_undo_savestate after calling
      o_place_end in function co_on_entry_activate.

    * src/x/x_dnd.c: Add calling o_undo_savestate after calling
      o_place_end in function x_dnd_receive_string_sym.

2015-03-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Restructure SCM Hook System

    * Expand SCM API (Hooks)

    * scheme/gschem/hook.scm: Add defines for change-page-hook, close-page-
      hook, and open-page-hook.

    * src/guile/g_hook.c: Add change-page-hook and close-page-hook to table
      gschem_hooks.

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Add call to g_hook_run_page change-page-hook in
      functions i_cmd_do_page_prev and i_cmd_do_page_next, close-page-hook
      in i_cmd_do_close and i_cmd_do_page_close. Add run hook in open-page-hook
      open_command_idle_notify. Add run hook in new-page-hook do_file_new.

2015-03-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Restructure SCM Hook System

    * Implement SCM Hook Enumeration

      The following modifications consolidates ALL of the strings for hook
      names to a single place in the code; the static structure gschem_hooks.
      Even though these strings are in one common static structure we still
      do not want to expose our privates to hookers so we still dynamically
      allocate storage for the string we pass but, as a fringe benifit, we
      can now do this in the idle thread g_hook_run_idle_callback, instead
      of g_hook_get_new_capsule, which is running as the primary thread.

2015-03-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Restructure SCM Hook System

    * src/guile/g_hook.c: Use union inside st_idle_hook_data structure and
      identify with enumerated EID_HOOK_TYPE.

    * include/gschem_struct.h: True again, stability theory did not
      pan out as expected. Revise as necessary to access union member.

2015-03-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * etc/system-gschemrc.scm: Move Lock and Unlock to bottom of
      Select menu. Changed keys to:

          "S S"  "edit-select"

2015-03-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Function Maintenance - Modularization of function names

    * src/guile/g_keys.c: Renamed functions:

            * g_find_key   -> g_keys_find_key
            * g_init_keys  -> g_keys_init
            * g_key_print  -> g_keys_print_key
            * g_key_equalp -> g_keys_equalp

2015-03-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Code Enhancement: Restructure SCM Hook System

    * Run Hooks in idle main context

    * include/gschem_struct.h: Add new struct st_idle_hook_data with type
      definition IdleHookData.

    * src/guile/g_funcs.c: Rename functions; g_init_hook to g_hook_init, replaced
      functions g_run_hook_object, g_run_hook_object_list, g_run_hook_page with
      new functions; g_hook_run_object, g_hook_run_object_list, g_hook_run_page.
      The old functions were renamed; g_hook_idle_run_object, g_hook_idle_run_page,
      and g_hook_idle_run_object_list. All functions names in the module are now
      consistence with the module, aka g_hook_xxx.

      The new functions accept the same arguments but instead of running the SCM
      hooks the functions setup task to run in the main context with new function
      g_hook_run_idle_callback routing page, object, and lists to the appropriate
      function, and new function g_hook_run_idle_notify finalizing the ordeal and
      releasing resources allocated by g_hook_get_new_capsule for each of the
      instigators; g_hook_run_object, g_hook_run_object_list and g_hook_run_page.

      The new system means mosts of the tasks that i_command_router dispatched
      through i_command_dispatch can now be ran directly in the worker threads
      without have to worry about stumbling across code that will invoke Guide
      outside the main loops, which was the motivation for developing the new
      scheme and this is a very good thing Johnny. Secondary benefits should
      be obvious; more efficient utilization of the thread pool, and lingering
      hooks should have less impact on over-all performance.

      Need to test each action separately, which will take time. Took a long
      to time to get current level of stability, but the new scheme should
      have a positive impact on stability and performance even if with the
      current thread schedule.

2015-03-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Add Text Marker Threshold to Preferences/Settings Dialog

    * src/x/x_settings.c: Removed the work "marker" from the labels for
      text markers because these controls are all in a frame the has a
      label with text "Markers", was too redundent.

    * src/x/x_settings_dialog.c:Revise module to add spinner control
      for CairoRenderer->text_marker_threshold as double on the text
      TAB sheet.

2015-03-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * New Feature: Implement User Customizable Text Marker Threshold

    *  etc/system-gschemrc.scm: Add new keyword text-marker-threshold.

    *  etc/user-gschemrc.scm: Add new keyword text-marker-threshold.

    *  Add code to implement user configurable text marker threshold, adding
       new functions i_var_restore_group_double and i_var_restore_global_double.

2015-03-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    *  gschem-tools-menu.scm: Change extention for bom output to ".csv" instead
       of "txt".

2015-03-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    *  include/globals.h: Add enumerators to mask EID_TEXT_SEARCH_DIRECTIVES.

    *  src/object/o_edit.c: Revise function o_edit_find_text, stopped short of
       a re-write, still need re-write but this will do for now.

    *  src/x/x_dialog.c: Enhance (or mutilate, depending on ones perspective,
       the Find Text dialog; add two check boxes. The first to allow searching
       for hidden attribute (while still hidden) and the second to automatically
       close pages that were descended into if the descend into hierarchy button
       was checked.

2015-03-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    *  Symbol Versioning System Enhancements

    *  Provide a more concise means for users to disable symbol version
       checking for individual components.

    *  src/x/x_edit_cprop.c: Split cell for symbol version with hbox and add
       checkbox to enable or disable version checking for a specific component,
       aka, toggle polarity of the symversion value.

2015-03-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    *  Symbol Versioning System Enhancements

    * src/x/x_dialog.c: The symbol changed notification dialog does not default
      to close and requires users to "click" the close button to close the dialog
      (as stipulated in the gtk documentation). This is undesirable behavior, the
      dialog is a message dialog and should simply go away if the user presses
      the enter key.

      Revise x_dialog_symbol_changed; create message dialog without buttons
      and then create a close button and add to the dialog, set tool tip
      for ATK, and focus to the widget before running the dialog instead of
      "showing" with unnecessary response signal to destroy the dialog.

      Revise constructor xd_add_changed_symbol_list to not check if pointer
      is a GTK Message dialog. Relocated loading list_store to later in the
      function to improve readability of the code, (flows more continuously)
      and change loading of the store to simpler while loop.

2015-03-11 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Improve Integration: Standardize Enumerations
      Replace remaining GTK_RESPONSE_xxx enumerators with corresponding
      GEDA_RESPONSE_xxx enumeration in files:

          src/x/x_settings_dialog.c
          src/x/x_compselect.c
          src/x/x_fileselect.c

2015-03-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_dnd.c: Raise main window when string for symbol in path dropped
      on the drawing area, this was really annoying. If object received then
      then main window came to foreground but not for a string, particularly
      when the symbol was known, in which case the symbol needs to be placed.

2015-03-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Resolve issues with Component Selection Dialog:

    * src/x/x_compselect.c: Revise function x_compselect_callback_response
      to redo logic for case response place.

    * src/x/x_event.c: Commented-out case COMPMODE for third button release.
      makes little difference either way.

2015-03-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Revise do_page_revert to not raise dialog to
      confirm reverting page if the page has not been modified, not only
      does this not make sense, it is an annoyance.

2015-03-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Fix bug in i_cmd_do_zoom_extents, the wrong
      enumerator was used in the CMD_WHO macro, was pasted from do_zoom_out

2015-03-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Improve Integration: Standard Enumerations

    * include/gschem_dialog.h: Remove GschemResponseType enumeration.

    * include/x_console.h: Remove ConsoleResponseType enumeration.

    * include/x_pagesel.h: Remove PageselResponseType enumeration.

      Change response type from GTK to cooresponding IDE_RESPONSE type in the
      following files:

          * src/guile/g_funcs.c
          * src/iface/i_command.c
          * src/object/o_complex.c
          * src/object/o_delete.c
          * src/x/x_autonumber.c

          * src/x/x_edit_text.c
          * src/x/x_fileselect.c
          * src/x/x_image.c

    * include/geda_enum.h: Create IDE_RESPONSE_TYPE in an effort standardize response
      enumeration. Rename other camel case enumerators with IDE prefix, do not look as
      good but at least consistence.

2015-03-09 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_edit_attrib.c: Rename file, formerly x_attrib.c

2015-03-09 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_move.c: Revert back to old scheme for canceling move operations,
      the old scheme is inefficient but the new scheme does not work correctly when
      undoing if component was rotated during the move. The old scheme appears to
      work correctly.

2015-03-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * New Feature Function - Auto-Snap Objects to Grid:

    * etc/system-gschemrc.scm: Add  key sequence "E N" for new action "edit-snap".
      also added alternate sequence "<Shift>S G" for snap grid, maybe easier to
      remember. Add menu "Edit/Snap to Grid" for new action "edit-snap".

    * include/i_actions.h: Add action EDIT_SNAP, resequenced EDIT_MIRROR before
      EDIT_MOVE.

    * include/i_command.h: Add entries for do_snap, relocated do_mirror before
      do_move.

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Add new action responder do_snap simply to pass
      selection list to...

    * src/object/o_edit.c: Add new utility function to snap all objects in the
      given list to the current grid snap. This should have been the very first
      function I ever added to gschem, (followed by the double click terminations
      added earlier today.)

2015-03-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_attrib.c: Updated order of arguments for o_attrib_attach
      in (recently added) function o_attrib_attach_list_2_object.

    * src/object/o_edit.c: Updated order of arguments for o_attrib_attach_list
      in function o_edit_update_component.

    * src/object/o_move.c: Updated order of arguments for o_get_position
      in function o_move_motion.

    * src/object/o_slot.c: Updated order of arguments for o_attrib_attach
      in function o_slot_end.

    * src/x/x_multiattrib.c: Update order of arguments for o_attrib_attach
      in function multiattrib_action_promote_attributes.

2015-03-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Restore Attributes font size when symbols updated:

    * src/object/o_edit.c: Revise function o_edit_update_component to
      restore the font size of attached attribute when symbols are re-
      loaded, also clean indentation, remove setting page change flag
      since this is done by libgeda, and revised Doxygen comments. May
      be need user settable list of what to restore, or open a dialog.

2015-03-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Major annoyence - UI Interation: Terminating Add modes:

    * src/x/x_event.c: Revised initial conditional for double clicks in
      function x_event_button_pressed, which previously only responded
      to SELECT events to launch associated edit dialogs, in order to
      terminate the add modes, yes NETMODE, PINMODE, LINEMODE, BOXMODE,
      CIRCLEMODE, ARCMODE, PICTUREMODE, and BUSMODE, if inside of an
      action! This seemed to work well during initial testing and has
      also been tested more extensively. This feature has intuitive feel,
      and probably should since when the lines, boxes, circles, and nets
      keep coming and wont go away, it seems natural to "click-it-off".
      I think this is a good thing.

2015-03-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Tweek Temporary Attribute Visibility experiment:

    * src/x/x_attrib.c: Revise x_dialog_attrib_edit_update_selection to use
      object->visibility != VISIBLE instead of o_get_is_visible (object) in
      conditional.

2015-03-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Fix magnetic nets not being erased:

    * src/object/o_net.c: Add call to o_net_invalidate_rubber in function
      o_net_reset, and set inside_action FALSE so the rubber circles get
      removed when motion occurs before the mouse button is released.

2015-03-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Make net-resume work again:

    * src/x/x_event.c: Fix new event scheme; modify x_event_button_released
      for third button release to not go into SELECT for NETMODE so that the
      old method of to resume drawing nets works properly. TODO: Buses should
      work the same way. C bus continuation works but not resume.

2015-03-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Completely revamp i_cmd_do_attach; allow pairs
      of object in any order. For selections greater than 3, the first object
      that can not be attached is the target, utilize w_current->which_object
      for the target object.

    * src/object/o_attrib.c: Add new function o_attrib_attach_list_2_object,
      which was orginally intended to relocated from i_cmd_do_attached, and
      mostly is, but added call to new libgeda::o_get_is_valid_attribute
      function, revise to use w_current->which_object as target object, and
      added o_undo_savestate.

      rename o_attrib_add_selected, again, this time to o_attrib_attached_2_
      selection, because o_attrib_add_attached_2_selection is too long.


2015-03-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_attrib.c: Revise and rename o_attrib_add_selected to
      o_attrib_add_2_selection; reverse conditional test for selection
      to eliminate premature return and rename variable selected_objects
      to objects_added, and corrected Doxygen header.

2015-03-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_attrib.c: Implement functions geda_list_remove_all
      and o_selection_unselect_all for testing.

2015-03-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_box.c: Fix o_box_end not invalidating rubber with zero
      width or height.

2015-03-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/base/gschem_dialog.c: Get rid of object selection wows in function
      gd_callback_selection_changed and just pass whatever o_select_return_
      first_object returns to the dialogs handler function. The dialogs were
      not getting called when the selection changed from something to nothing.

2015-03-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_edit_cprop.c: Redo update selection handler, add functions
      x_dialog_ep_no_selection and x_dialog_ep_set_sensitive to set all
      entries to NULL and disable the widgets when there no selection,
      and is not editing a symbol file.

2015-03-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * x/x_compselect.c: Increase width of reference optionsmenu button in
      function create_action_area.

2015-03-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_status.c: Add local inline, set_all_need_object_false
      in function i_status_idle_update_sensitivities, and revise logic to
      to not continue checking selection list if not any_object.

2015-03-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_coord.c: Revise co_on_entry_activate to use code relocated
      to libgeda, function u_string_parse_xy, to interpret strings entered
      into the workd entry.

2015-03-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_complex.c: Revise function o_complex_translate_all
      to not disconnect and update connection as this is now done by
      libgeda when using libgeda::o_list_translate function.

    * Use lower level translator when performing place operation

    * src/object/o_place.c: Revise o_place_end to use o_translate_object
      in existing For loop instead of calling o_list_translate before
      entering the For loop.

2015-03-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Use lower level translator when starting paste buffer operation

    * src/object/o_buffer.c: Revise o_buffer_paste_start to loop through

2015-03-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_pagesel.c: Revise recent modification to PageSel dialog to
      eliminate the pagesel-full_names varible that was added. Instead,
      get pointer to widget stored in dialog and get the state directly
      from the toggle switch widget.

2015-03-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Enhance Recent File menu

    * src/x/x_menus.c: Include full path name as tool-tips for recent files
      sub-menu items when menu tool-tips are enabled and the full paths are
      not.

2015-03-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Fix Bug: Main menu items not toggling icons and tool-tips:

    * src/x/x_menus.c: Save non-action menu items that can be activated to
      single linked list of menu items, MENU_ITEMS_LIST, so the tooltips
      and icons for these item will be toggled by x_menu_toggle_tips and
      x_menu_toggle_tips.

2015-03-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_menus.c: Allow users to not show the path when displaying the
      file names in the recent file submenu, this is useful because the menu
      items can be long and Gtk sets the width of the menu so larger that
      the recent submenu covers over the file menu and blocks the remaining
      items like "file/save".

      1.) Create static int show_recent_path

      2.) Restore the state of show_recent_path in x_menu_setup_ui (when the
          state of other toggle menu items is retrieved.

      3.) Retain the state of show_recent_path in x_menu_save_state.

      4.) Added popup callback function x_menu_toggle_recent_path.

      5.) Added "Show path" menu item to recent file menu popup in function
          x_menu_recent_show_popup.

      6.) Revised function x_menu_attach_recent_submenu, adding filename
          variable, to use the show_recent_path when build the recent-files
          submenu.

      Added doxygen comment for function x_menu_recent_file_clicked.

2015-03-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * include/x_pagesel.h: Add defines for COLUMN_CHANGED and COLUMN_NAME
      MIN_WIDTH, add boolean full_names to data structure.

    * src/x/x_pagesel.c: Enhance Page Select Dialog:

      1.) Fix the camel case I screwed-up along time ago: TYPE_PageSEL

      2.) Add a configuration define for the dialog, IDS_PAGE_MANAGER
          Forgot or did not realize PageSel was even derived from Gschem
          Dialog class.

      3.) Added a toggle switch to allow user the option to have file
          names display with or without the path. The state of the
          toggler is stored in the dialog`s data structure with the
          variable full_names.

      4.) Add cell render data function, which, based upon the state of
          full_names, use libgeda function f_get_basename to advance ptr
          past the path in the page file name.

      5.) Added a dummy spacer column, COLUMN_SPACER, tried both before and
          after the COLUMN_CHANGED, (column of checkboxes), aka last column
          and both seemed to work okay. Gtk column resizing is flaky at best
          and much time was spent on this step fighting Gtk to size columns
          correctly, which of course was a fight I could not win until the
          extra column was added. I think it looks/works better between the
          filename and the checkbox column.

      6.) Added function pagesel_finalize, and setup in pagesel_class_init,
          to retain the users preference in configuration, the setting is
          restore in pagesel_init.

      7.) Revamp the action area buttons, Gtk was expanding Refresh and
          Close buttons, see gtk_dialog_add_action_widget source (2.0),
          (later versions of Gtk-3.x appear to not do this). After much
          todo, fell-back to traditional approach of scrapping the stock
          action area and creating new widgets utilizing an alignment and
          necessitating two new callback functions:

                    pagesel_callback_refresh_clicked
                    pagesel_callback_close_clicked

          to deliver the dialogs response. The main purpose here was to
          be able to shrink the dialog size, or at least allow user to
          reduce the size of the dialog window. With the two buttons
          expanding, the buttons were propping the entire dialog to more
          than 500 pixels wide.

      8.) Revise macro DEFINE_POPUP_CALLBACK to (1) be more comprehensible,
          and (2), call i_command_process directly instead of calling the
          separate i_callback_xxx_xx functions like i_callback_page_close.
          (Not sure if these are used by anymore, since i_command registers
          all actions with Guile there is no reason for scm to use these
          function.) Maybe remove latter.

      9.) Is dawn, snow mostly gone, time to sleep.

2015-03-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/base/gschem.c: Check if command line argument contains an
      unexpanded wild-card (which could happen if specified wild-card
      did not match, for example *.sch when there are no .sch files in
      the current directory), issue a warning to log event and disable
      the auto-load-last feature to avoid confusion, notify user feature
      was disable if verbose message is enabled.

    * ./: Revised similar to modifications to the Master branch by Vladimir
      Zhbanov, see commit d05cdff849010233a7bfb6af36e9ac303bf6f9e7 Replaces
      state enumeration MOVE, STARTMOVE, and ENDMOVE with MOVEMODE, but the
      MOVEMODE state is handled differently so as to allow user to move
      objects without having to hold the 1st button down the entire time of
      the move operation. Add new state flag DRAGMOVE to distinguish moves
      initiated by dragging from the command action "edit-move". Dragging is
      terminated when the user releases the button.

    * include/x_states.h: Revise state enumerators and resequence.

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Revise do_move and to use new enumeration state,

      the event states and status messages. Update functions x_dnd_drag_end and
      x_dnd_source_leave with COPYMODE enumerator.

    * src/x/x_event.c: Revise module to use new enumeration state for DRAGMOVE
      and MOVEMODE. DRAGMOVE is ONLY initiated by x_event_motion and terminates
      when the button is release by x_event_button_released. MOVEMODE is allowed
      to persist until the second button down, with the first capturing the move
      from point.

      by Vladimir Zhbanov, see commit fcc3fe82dcd10de37857291fbff8fc7614b7cfab
      The basic concept is to relocate code from case handlers in event loops
      to the o_select module in order to improve readability of code in the
      x_event module, (and potentially linearize handlers). The Rampage version
      of gschem handles selection slightly differently than the Master branch;
      drag moving can be disabled with drag_can_move (because sometimes things
      get moved unintentionally), and the Rampage version supports drag-and-drop
      events.

    * src/object/o_select.c: Add functions o_select_start, o_select_end, and
      o_select_motion.

2015-02-19 Vladimir Zhbanov <vzhbanov@gmail.com>

    * src: Applied updates similar to revisions to Master branch by Vladimir
      Zhbanov, see commits 21de1374a2b07e87b6cdb5c45068514a7ef7e56c through
      6e840360d6ec5ca1083c910f614807e2bdccf3c7 with the main differences being:
      did not add w_current->pathcontrol, handle NETMODE seperately in
      o_redraw_rectangle so as to draw magnetic markers when not in action,
      allow control key to constrain paths, and event processing is slightly
      different, such that canceling leaves objected selected the same as the
      "old" gschem.

2015-02-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_event.c: Revised function x_event_button_pressed as follows:
      removed GedaToplevel toplevel variable, add GList list variable, removed
      setting inside_action FALSE after o_place_end.

    * src/object/o_place.c: Revised function o_place_end to set inside_action
      to the value of continue_placing that was passed in and set the page
      pointer of current objects to NULL before appending to the current page.
      Rename temp_dest_list to object_list for consistency with other modules,
      and connected_objects to connected_list.

    * src/object/o_copy.c: Revise function o_copy_end to not set inside_action
      since the desired value is passed to o_place_end. Add local integers to
      eliminate line breakage in o_place_end and o_copy_multiple_end.
      Eliminated setting of page pointer to NULL in o_place_end and o_copy_
      multiple_end since this also is performed in o_place_end.

    * src/object/o_buffer.c: Relocate variables declaration to local scope and
      rename rside to side, these are no longer floating.

    * src/x/x_dnd.c: Revise function x_dnd_drag_receive to not set inside_action

    * src/object/o_extend.c: New module for action edit-extend, is unique
      in that the action/command operates on preselected objects like other
      actions and also as verb-nouns, extending objects not selected before
      the command/action was initiated. Either boundaries or projectile type
      objects can be preselected, or both can be preselected. In the later
      case, the routines act on all selected objects and terminates the
      command/action. The action can also be initiated with the keyboard
      with preselected project, which are then extended/projected based
      on the current cursor position.

   ** src/math/m_basic.c: Revised function snap_grid() to be a little
      snappier. Basically; eliminated conditional and get sign bit by
      bit shifting, use mask to make positive by toggling bits using

    * src/object/o_undo.c: Revised per Vladimir Zhbanov`s updates to the
      master branch; to not delete the page and create new pages for undo
      type UNDO_DISK, commit 191de3c1a443572d35335fa7148db0dfc5e4b490.
      Would have thought this would be faster but is not, for object counts
      around 350, deleting the page is slightly faster, even with all the
      crap I went though below to fix. For high object count files, the
      one I tested had 4080 objects, the performence was virtually equal.
      Re-creating the page is cleaner solution and not calling was a serious
      bug.

2014-10-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      type UNDO_DISK so that the page list stays in the same order. Previous
      when ever an undo operation was perform, that page would appended to
      the end of page list, this was annoying when working with multiple
      pages as the order kept changing when undoing.

2014-10-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

   ** src/object/o_net.c: Remove w_current->inside_action = 1 in function

2014-09-19 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_image.c: Use GedaFileChooser instead of GtkFileChooser because on some
      system GedaFileChooser does not restore geometry properly (not at all) and our
      chooser widget does.

2014-09-18 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_basic.c: Removed tree row visibility support function, which are now

2014-09-17 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_grid.c: More work on the dots grid; added dual grids like the mesh
      grid with major and minor dots, along with separate user controllable color
      and alpha settings. cario-turtle-arc is God awful slow. Compared to X11 cario
      takes twice as long to draw the dots grid. Drawing directly using X11 works
      good but cario did not respect the activated pixels in the buffer, for example
      when dragging a new component the component acted like an eraser for the dots
      grid, (but not the mesh, which is drawn using cario). The dots grid would not
      be refreshed until the component was placed. And the alpha was not uniform.
      Cario seems more suited for simple drawing programs and not well suited for
      high-performance CAD systems.

      Also added user configurable anti-alias variable for cairo_set_antialias but
      differences in image quality between CAIRO_ANTIALIAS_FAST and CAIRO_ANTIALIAS_
      GOOD varied from poor to no-so-good, with CAIRO_ANTIALIAS_BEST generating X11
      errors. The glyph quality is even worst.

2014-09-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * *: Add new rc`able variable anti-aliasing (to allow user control of screen
      drawing quality, and added grip-pixel-size, which was already in the new

    * src/x/x_grid.c: Eliminate call to inside_region in functions x_grid_draw
      _dots_region, was in the wrong place and too late of X was out of bounds.
      Add if (i < Current_Page->left) in outer loop and if (j < Current_Page->top)
      in inner loop, this eliminate repeated calls to WORLDtoSCREEN and many extra
      inned loops with out-of-bounds X.

2014-09-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_grid.c: Added revises dots grid for user settable color from

2014-09-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * *: Add color and transparency for the mesh grid, with rc variables.
      The alpha transparency can not yet be set in the preferences dialog
      but the color can be. Also add mesh line width factor so user can
      better customize the mesh grid. Is a work in progress, but believed
      to be fully functional now.

      x_window_close_edit_dialogs to function x_window_close_all_dialogs
      so the page manager will not be close when opening a session.

2014-09-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * scheme/gschem-tools-menu.scm: Add check and prompt to save the file if
      the current page has been modified because it was really annoying when
      I made a change and forget to save before generating a netlist. There
      is also an option to cancel the operation.

2014-09-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/guile/g_funcs.c: Resequenced general guile functions is Aphabetical
      order. Add API function "gschem-save-file" g_funcs_save_file, see source
      documentation.

2014-09-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x_dialog.c: Rename generic gschem_xxx message dialog x_dialog,
      add dialog x_dialog_confirmation, a two button yes or no, rename
      previous three button gschem_confirm_dialog to "x_dialog_confirm_
      with_cancel".

    * src/guile/g_funcs.c: Provide scheme API for g_funcs_confirm_cancel

    * src/guile/g_register.c: Register API "gschem-confirm-cancel" for
      old three button g_funcs_confirm_cancel, leaving the old API for
      the new two button version.

2014-09-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * scheme/gschem-tools-menu.scm: Add spice-noqsi to tools menu, is hack
      until a better arrangement can be implemented.

    * src/math/m_basic.c: Renamed round_5_2_1 to m_round_5_2_1

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Remove Current_Page->CHANGED in do_delete.

    * src/iface/i_status.c: Add strcmp in i_status_update_status

2014-09-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/x/x_*.c: Revise file headers, update doxygen documentation; add
      more grouping.

2014-09-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_status.c: Use g_idle_add  to update sensitivities in idle
      thread, a modest improvement was detected during Undo performance testing,
      = 3.27 ns per object faster. Add doxygen (subgroups) for sensitivities,
      and sensitivity helper functions.

    * src/x/x_scroll.c: Use g_idle_add  to update scrollbars in idle thread,
      a modest improvement was detected during Undo performance testing, =
      1.12 ns per object faster.

    * src/object/o_undo.c: Use x_scrollbars_update instead of calling
      x_hscrollbar_update and x_vscrollbar_update separately.

2014-09-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_undo.c: Implemented GedaNotifyList in o_undo_callback
      and confirmed notifiers survive undo cycles using diagnostics tools.
      Added freeze/thaw will no significant improvement, even though it has
      to be a good thing to not do notification while no page exist. Then
      postponed thawing until right before o_invalidate_all and measured
      radical improvements in performance. Posting gnumeric data in root,
      temporarily, currently at about 33us/per object faster. This is by
      far the most significant improvement so far. And as a bonus, gschem`s
      Undo system appears to working correctly!

2014-09-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_diagnostics.c: Add more functionality to diagnostics
      dialog, second table, print_page_info button and function plus
      add and remove seperate callback notifiers.

2014-09-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_vars.c: Create i_set_rc in i_vars_set and implement for
      variables in key file but also can be set with rc file.

2014-09-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * include/gschem_idefines.h: Replace defines for UNDO_DISK and UNDO
      _MEMORY with enumerated UNDO_TYPE.

2014-09-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_undo.c: Replace g_strdup_printf with u_string_sprintf.

2014-09-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_diagnostics.c: Temporarily disable backups so as not to
      interfere with tests. This is only done for the current file, which
      should be the only file open during testing.

2014-09-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/o/o_edit.c: Relocated function o_autosave_backups to
      libgeda::o_save::o_save_auto_backup, seems like a better
      place, did not really "fit" in with any gschem module.

2014-09-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/base/gschem.c: Moved o_undo_init after the log initialization so
      that if command-line -t options is used, the event will be logged.

    * src/iface/i_diagnostics.c: Revise performance test routines for Undo
      so that function <test_undo_randomly_delete> is not so random, skips
      symversion attributes because this generates errors when an Undo file
      is loaded with older version=0 symbols, cluttering the log.

2014-09-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * docs/gschem.1.in: Update with new command line option.

    * include/globals.?: Add new global variable tmp_directory for
      new command-line option.

    * src/base/gschem_parsecmd.c: Add new option -t/--tmp-dir using
      global variable tmp_directory

    * src/object/o_undo.c: Implement new global variable tmp_directory
      in function o_undo_init.

2014-09-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_sessions.c: Change u_log_message to v_log_message in
      i_session_close_all, is too noisy.  The session opening get logged
      right after the i_session_close_all function anyways.

2014-09-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_undo.c: Exert due diligence to find a read-writable
      temporary directory in o_undo_init, alert user and switch to type
      UNDO_MEMORY if unsuccessful. Add doxygen grouping and some source
      documentation. Performance result (so far), based on average of
      500 undo operations for each type, 308 objects:

                  seconds per  | Avg seconds  | milli-seconds
                    10 Undo    | per 1 Undo   |  per object
      --------------------------------------------------------
      UNDO_MEMORY   0.4790     |   0.0479     |    0.1555
      UNDO DISK     0.6306     |   0.0631     |    0.2048

      This is before any real tweeking, but o_basic.c::o_save was revised
      to use fopen/fputs/fclose back in 2012-10-31, and that has to be a
      major performance boost. The master branch still uses the hideously
      despicable g_file_set_contents. The module also uses DIR_SEPARATOR
      instead of G_DIR_SEPARATOR.

      These results seems unreasonably fast; I4820@3.7GHz, i.e. 4 channel
      1600MHz memory, tmp directory is on tmpfs, so the only significant
      difference is the io schedule, in this case BFQ. Good development
      machine, maybe not so good for performance testing.

2014-08-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/iface/i_command.c: Relocated diagnostic dialog to a separate file,
      still compiled with i_command module. Extensive revisions in function
      i_cmd_do_debug (essentially a responder still located in i_command.c).

    * src/iface/diagnostics.c: New file with performance diagnostics dialog
      code previously located in i_command.c; dialog extensively revised and
      a performance test for the Undo system was added.

2014-08-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/o/o_delete.c: Delete page_current->CHANGED from o_delete, libgeda
      already sets the flag in s_page_remove_object.

    * src/x/x_multiattrib.c: removed page_current->CHANGED in function
      multiattrib_action_delete_attributes, which calls o_delete.

2014-08-30 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

2014-08-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_fileselect.c: Swap gtk_file_chooser_* for geda_file_chooser_*

2014-08-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/Makefile.am: Add link to libgeda.

        * src/iface/i_vars.c: New varibles chooser_filter initialized with
          new varible default_chooser_filter. Restored in i_vars.c, saved
          with the windows group by x_window_save_settings.

        * src/x/x_window.c: Add new varible to save in x_window_save_settings,
          x_window_save_settings using key "chooser-filter".

        * src/x/x_fileselect.c: In x_fileselect_list and x_fileselect_open,
          set filter of new GedaFileChooser to the retained preferences using
          new top-level variable chooser_filter, and add callback handler for
          the filter to capture user changes. Set GedaFileChooser filter for
          save dialog to what ever the current document type, i.e. "sch" for
          schematics, "sym" if saving a symbol.

2014-08-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_fileselect.c: Relocated GschemFileFilterDataDef structure to
          GedaFileFilterDataDef in libgedauio/src/dialogs/geda_file_chooser.c
          Revised functions; x_fileselect_list, x_fileselect_open and
          x_fileselect_save to use new GedaFileChooser instead of GtkFileChooser
          Dialog. Let local library focus on gui stuff.

2014-08-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * etc/system-gschemrc.scm, user-gschemrc.scm: Change default to show
          file preview.

        * src/iface/i_vars.c: Change default to enable file preview.

2014-08-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * iface/i_command.c: Increase load factor to decrease priority of
          cleanup by magnitude of order for each file, tested with 41 files,
          okay, all symbols.

2014-08-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * iface/i_command.c: Fixed cmd_do_open, was not suppose to do release
          cleanup block if dialog canceled, code block was suppose to be in
          the conditional, oops.

2014-08-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * iface/i_command.c: Add union to gschem_task so binary functions
          can be tasked, (structure had two arguments but only allowed for
          usage of one).
          Revised function cmd_do_open to open each file name returned by
          x_fileselect_list using separate task in the main context, and
          added idle handler support to release the memory involved in the
          operation. This seems to have given gschem a hole new "snap", not
          just when opening multiple schematics, but even for a single
          document. No data, but perception is that this is dramatic change.
          But the real reason for all of this is so a worker thread can be
          used to spawn multiple task in the main loop so that when guile
          is used by libgeda, the scheme runs in the main context, aka fix
          stack over-flows.

        * src/x/x_fileselect.c: New function x_fileselect_list, is like
          x_fileselect_open, but returns the list of file names instead
          of opening them.

2014-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/?/?.c: replace if !quiet with q_log_message in:
                gschem.c::gschem()
                x_window.c::x_window_open_page()

2014-08-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_edit_pin.c: Redo Edit Pin dialog to allow for alphanumeric
          pin numbers, rather than only integers.

2014-08-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/object/o_pin.c: Remove set page changed in o_pin_end, this
          already gets done in libgeda when the pin is appended to the
          page.

2014-08-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_edit_pin.c: Connect apply callback to pin label entry so
          that pressing enter updates the pin object.

2014-08-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_attrib.c: In function attrib_edit_dialog_ok, set new pin
          label attributes to color TEXT_COLOR, instead of ATTRIBUTE_COLOR.

2014-08-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_attrib.c: Conditionally set default response so callback
          can identify mode (either SAE_ADD_MODE or SAE_EDIT_MODE)

2014-08-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_attrib.c: geda_combo_box_text_new_with_entry instead of
          gtk_combo_box_entry_new_text.

2014-08-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_window.c: In function x_window_open_page, change
          "Loading schematic" to just "Loading" because the same routine
          loads both schematics and symbols.

2014-08-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_attrib.c: Explicitly set focus order for dialog.

2014-08-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_dialog.c: Add o_invalidate in x_dialog_edit_line_type_ok
          so display is updated when apply button is pressed.

2014-08-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * etc/system-gschemrc.scm: Include module "gschem hook". This is not
          currently done in system-gschemrc, but potentially could be.

        * include/i_command.h: Change do_add_arc from USE_XY_WORKER to
          USE_XY_MAIN_LOOP, for guile, potentially could be an issue.

        * src/x/x_dialog.c: Add check for DRAWARC event_state in x_dialog_edit
          _arc_angle_apply to distinguish editing from creation of new arcs.

2014-07-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_dialog.c: Add o_invalidate in x_dialog_edit_arc_angle_apply
          so that arc objects are updated on the screen during apply.

2014-07-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * *: w_current->pl: A good riddance.

2014-07-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/gschem_pango.h: Remove file, obsolete

2014-07-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/object/o_text.c: In function o_text_edit_end, add calls to
          o_invalidate (w_current, object), before making changes, if old
          text should be erased because this was leaving remnants on the
          screen and use flag "invalidated" so o_invalidate is not called
          multiple times.

2014-07-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/iface/i_command.c: Eliminate call to o_add_change_notify from
          do_file_new_window because this is done in x_window_open_page.

2014-07-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/object/o_text.c: Remove setting the page changed flag in
        functions o_text_change and o_text_edit_end because libgeda does
        this in o_text_recreate, eliminated toplevel varible in o_text_
        change because this was only used to reference the changed flag.

2014-07-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_compselect.c: In function x_compselect_callback_response,
          add back the set cswindow=NULL, because later in the same function
          o_redraw_cleanstates, which calls x_compselect_deselect before the
          base class has opportunity to set cswindow=NULL. Note, was add back
          on in the condition to call o_redraw_cleanstates since the base class
          is still going to execute these instructions.

2014-07-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/globals.h, src/iface/i_basic.c, src/x/x_toolbars.c: fixed
          unintentional camel case for EID_SENITIVITY_MODE enumerators.

2014-07-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/gschem_idefines.h: Change DEFAULT_TEXT_MARKER_SIZE

          in function o_attrib_toggle_visibility

2014-07-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/object/o_text.c: Pass pointers to integer instead of pointers
          to double, change fmin/fmax to min, max in o_text_get_rendered_bounds
          function.

2014-07-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/.c: Redo inclusion of header files

2014-07-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_toolbars.c: Replace mkdir with f_create_path in function
          x_toolbars_save_state.

        * /src/x/x_window.c: Replace mkdir with f_create_path in function
          x_toolbars_save_state and remove inclusion of glib/gstdio.h.
          Modified error message to include reason path creation failed.

2014-07-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_menus.c: Replace g_mkdir with f_create_path in function
          recent_files_load.

2014-07-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/gschem_idefines.h: Change DEFAULT_JUNCTION_SIZE gtom 10 to 40;

        * src/x/x_settings_dialog.c: Add missing junction_size in unloader.

2014-07-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/iface/i_command.c: Fix bug in do_add_bus() by removing superfluous
          w_current->inside_action = 0.

        * src/x/x_window.c: Bug fix: Grid/snap was not being update in the status
          bar after starup with new "empty" blank page, added call in function
          empty_page() to x_status_bar_update_grid_label.

2014-07-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * /include/globals.h: Enumerate EID_ZOOM_DIRECTIVE and EID_PAN_DIRECTIVES,
           these were previously compiler defines located in gschem_idefines.h.

        * src/iface/i_zoom_world.c: Function i_zoom_world: Changed second argument
          to enumerated type ZOOM_DIRECTIVE, third argument to enumerated type
          EID_ACTION_ORIGIN, forth and final argument to enumerated type
          EID_PAN_DIRECTIVES.

2014-07-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * scheme/Makefile.am: Add gschem/ *~ to cleaning lists

        * include/i_command.h: Change actions VIEW_SELECTED, VIEW_EXTENTS,

          VIEW_ZOOM_IN and VIEW_ZOOM_OUT from USE_MAIN_LOOP to USE_XY_WORKER.

2014-07-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_menus.c: Revise Popup creator x_menu_setup_popup and use
          column 3 in popup structure to nest Add, Zoom and Hierarchy

2014-07-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/base/gschem_dialog.c: Add function set_gschem_dialog_null
        so that pointers in GschemToplevel are automatically set to NULL
        when GschemDialog objects are destroyed.
        Removed w->current->xxwindow from (hopefully) all GschemDialogs
        in files:
                  src/x/x_attrib.c
                  src/x/x_compselect.c

2014-07-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * *: More work on Doxygen documentation, added groups, reorganized
          existing groups. Added additional documentation, mostly group and
          file level comments. Changed group delimiters to use a different
          style than function documentation, add and end group use the double
          asterisk, as oppose to the asterisk exclamation pair so as to allow
          independent indexing and while searching documentation/comments.

        * src/x/x_dialog.c: Relocate code for "bulbs" from x_settings.c.

2014-07-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/iface/i_sessions.c: Revised and completed Doxygen documentation.

        * src/x/x_sessions.c: Revised and completed Doxygen documentation.

          macros with gschem_threads_enter gschem_threads_leave for main loop.

        * src/iface/i_threads.c: New module/file.

        * src/iface/i_command.c: Replace gdk_threads_enter and gdk_threads_leave
          with gschem_threads_enter gschem_threads_leave and remove  call to
          gdk_flush() in i_command_router, since gschem_threads_leave makes this
          call.

        * src/x/x_dialog.c: Replace gdk_threads_enter and gdk_threads_leave with
          gschem_threads_enter gschem_threads_leave in gschem_confirm_dialog.

        * src/x/x_fileselect.c: Replace gdk_threads_enter and gdk_threads_leave
          with gschem_threads_enter gschem_threads_leave in x_fileselect_load_
          backup.

        * src/x/x_image.c: Replace gdk_threads_enter and gdk_threads_leave with
          gschem_threads_enter gschem_threads_leave in x_image_setup.

2014-07-19 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * etc/system-gschemrc.scm: Incoorperate gschem-tools-menu.scm to add
          tool menu subitems, so netlist can be generated directly from gschem

        * src/guile/g_action.c: Call new function action_body_eval() instead
          of g_scm_eval_protected in g_action_eval_by_name.

        * src/x/x_dialog.c: Add thread flag to gschem_confirm_dialog as tmp
          fix.

        * scheme/gschem-tools-menu.scm: remove ".sh" from gnet_hier_verilog

2014-07-17 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/base/gschem.c: Add conditional with scm_is_null to check
          for pre and post procedure to eliminate call to g_scm_eval
          _protected when expressions are absent from command-line.

2014-07-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/all/.c: Replace g_malloc with GEDA_MEM_ALLOC

2014-07-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/base/gschem.c: New function load_documents, with code
          relocated from function gschem(), in order to better organize
          and clarify coding. Auto-load-last now will work if command
          line options are used.

        * src/base/gschem_parsecmd.c: Change comman-line characters to
          more sensible values:

                 -c EXPR -> -x
                 -r      -> -c, --config-file=FILE
                 -s FILE -> -r, --run (is really like --config-file)

          Added new variables: override_autoload and start_session to
          support new comman-line options.

        * docs/gschem.1.in: Updated command line arguments

        * src/x/x_window.c: Eliminate g_return_if_fail if page is NULL in
          x_window_close_page(), change to conditional with BUG message,
          the "CRITICAL" is too alarming.

        * src/iface/i_sessions.c: Added conditional to only  call x_window
          _close_page() if page is not NULL.

2014-07-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x/x_window.c: New function x_window_close_edit_dialogs to
          close almost dialog boxes. Revise x_window_close_all_dialogs to
          call x_window_close_edit_dialogs. Use q_log_message instead of
          "if verbose" in function x_window_open_page and verbose_mode
          instead of quiet_mode in empty_page when create file names for
          blank documents.

          Revise function x_window_close_page to not log closing "untitled"
          unless verbose_mode.

          The preceed changes reduce log "noise" for untitled, aka blank,
          documents and allow the console and coordinate dialog to stay
          open when closing and opening documents. This is in support of
          the new "Session" feature.

        * src/iface/i_command.c: Add i_set_state(SELECT) in functions;
          do_close, do_close_all,

        * src/iface/i_basic.c: Revamp function i_set_filename.

        * src/iface/i_sessions.c: New source containing core algorithms
          for sessions to be saved and loaded. This new features allows
          users to save the names of all open documents in "session"
          configuration files, stored in the "configuration"/session
          directory. When sessions are recalled, the collection of files,
          if they exist, are opened - I like, WEH.

        * src/x/x_sessions.c: New source containing dialog routines to
          support the new Session feature, including a "manager" dialog
          to delete, rename and export sessions. Still need to valid and
          and finalize session-at-startup.

2014-07-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/all/all.c: Conditionally include <sys/stat.h>

2014-07-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/gschem_xdefines.h: Rename DIALOG_BORDER_SPACING to
          DIALOG_BORDER_WIDTH.

        * src/x/?dialog.c: Relocate gtk_container_border_width and
          gtk_box_set_spacing to base class for type GschemDialog to
          reduce redundent coding.

        * src/x/x_settings.c: Add gettext to u_log_messages.

2014-07-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/all/all.c: Replace g_strdup with geda_strdup

        * src/iface/i_command.?: Add new action "file-close-all" as file
          menu item.

2014-07-11 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/object/o_picture.c: Force gtk_file_chooser_dialog to start in
          current directory.

        * src/x/x_image.c: Fix last_extents and last_image_type. Force
          gtk_file_chooser_dialog to start in current directory.

        * src/x/x_print.c: Force gtk_file_chooser_dialog to start in
          current directory.

2014-07-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/all: Use new macro GEDA_UREF instead if g_object_unref where
          applicable.

2014-07-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/base/gschem_dialog.c: Added tail_marker to check for instance,
          function gschem_dialog_instance_init, and is_a_gschem_dialog, which
          is wrapped by GSCHEM_IS_DIALOG macro.

        * src/x/x_dialog.c: Changed arguments to gtk_entry_new_with_max_length
          to defined constants defined in x_dialog.h. Changed x_dialog_find_text
          to use remember_page instead of w_current->ftwindow as new (start) flag.

        * src/x/x_edit_pin.c: Added brackets for conditionals is function
          x_dialog_edit_pin_type_set_values

2014-07-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/object/o_misc.c: Implement show net names (toggle).

2014-03-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/o_undo: Added call to o_add_change_notify after new page created
          in function o_undo_callback.

        * src/x_compselect.c: Replace gtk_label_new with geda_label_new in
          compselect_constructor

        * src/x_autonumber.c: Replace gtk_label_new with geda_label_new in
          autonumber_create_dialog.

        * src/x_dialog.c: Replace gtk_label_new with geda_label_new in

        * src/g_action.c: Fixed leak in g_process_action, freed action_str

2014-03-11 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/all: Source directory structure re-vamped. Sub-directories created for
          gschem, guile, iface, math, object, view, and x.

        * src/widgets: Files were relocate to a seperate compilation unit for new
          library libgedauio.

        * src/i_pan_world.c: Rename to v_pan.c and relocated to new view subdirectory

Rename to v_zoom.c and relocated to new view subdirectory

        * src/a_zoom.c: parsecmd.c renamed  src/gschem/gschem_parsecmd.c and renamed
          function parse_commandline to gschem_parse_commandline for consistency with
          other compilation units, is not totally consistence but should be intuitive
          enough.

        * src/s_stretch.c: This file was eliminated, the code contents were originaly
          added to gschem to support implicit drag-moves, and each of the containing
          functions were only being call once, and all by functions within o_move.c,
          therefore the code was relocated to the o_move.c file with the functions
          being renamed o_move_stretch_xxx.

2014-03-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/i_pan_world.c: Add conditional in i_pan_world_general() so i_update_grid_info
          is only called if the zoom changed. Without the conditional, the function
          was being called when the view was only panned, which does not require
          updating the status.

        * src/i_basic.c: Functionality of i_update_grid_info is now performed by
          the status-bar object, i_update_grid_info now calls the function
          x_status_bar_update_grid_label in x_status_bar.c, which emits a signal
          on the status-bar object if an update is required.

        * src/g_rc.c: Revised g_rc_parse_gtkrc to log status of gschem-gtkrc
          processing (this may have been once upon-a-time but was somewhat
          annoying) using v_log_message and q_log_message.

        * etc/gschem-gtkrc: Commented out the setting of the font (again)

        * src/gschem.c: Relocated call to function i_vars_libgeda_freenames to
          libgeda.c function libgeda_release();

        * *: Created new GschemToplevel gobject for w_current rather than using
          a static structure and revised all code throughout the project as needed.
          This does not seem to be as usefull as with the libgeda because Gschem
          was resolving dynamically allocated memory when shutdown. Seemly, the
          only real benifit is the ability to use GSCHEM_IS_TOPLEVEL as oppose
          to checking for w_current == NULL. tanto opere, tam parum lucratus.

        * src/Makefile.am: Changed AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = $(GEDA_AUTO_MAKE_OPTIONS)

        * tests/Makefile.am: Added AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = $(GEDA_AUTO_MAKE_OPTIONS)
          $(GEDA_AUTOMAKE_TEST_OPTIONS)

        * src/o_misc.c: Added const quailifier to third argument of functions
          o_edit_find_text, o_edit_hide_specific_text, and o_edit_show
          _specific_text.

        * src/x_settings_dialog.c: In function GatherSettings, changing tmpstr
          to const char*.

2013-10-17 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/globals.h: New macro Current_Page =  w_current->
          toplevel->page_current created to shorten line lengths and
          to eliminate local variables created only for this purpose.
          Relocated macros Place_List and Top_Selection to libgeda/
          include/libgeda/geda_list.h, because this seems a more
          appropriate place for these.

        * src/gschem.c: Added directives for conditional compiling of
          g_mem_profile stuff rather than using comments.

        * src/i_command: Added new variable <accelerator> in function
          i_command_router - meant to do this sooner. The router now
          checks the last_command first, which i_command_process just
          set so i_command_router would normally do only one string
          comparison. Added mutex, with GMACROS, to the last_command
          variable. This was previously tested and deemed unnecessary
          but was added back because last_command is now accessed by
          i_command_router, just in case glib dawdle around getting
          the task going. Extensive testing using internal thread
          analysis code indicates glib does not dawdle, but CPU maybe
          faster than the norm, so hard to gauge.
          New macro BEGIN_W_COMMAND used to replace the combination of
          NOT_NULL and BEGIN_COMMAND.
          Implemented new Current_Page macro to eliminate PAGE *parent
          to refer to w_current->toplevel->page_current in multiple
          functions, I think these also improved readability.
          Replaced g_list_next() NEXT macro.

        * src/o_misc.c: Added in parameter to the o_edit function so that
          handler can know where the command originated. Currently, this
          information is not utilized.

        * src/o_move.c: replaced g_list_free with s_place_free_place_list in
          function o_move_cancel.

        * src/x_edit_attrib.c: Removed DECLARE_TOOPTIPS, see log entry
          for 09/27.

        * src/x_event.c: Change 3 parameter from x_event_configure to
          GschemToplevel like the other event handlers, re-sequenced
          functions in file.

        * src/x_compselect.c: Replaced s_delete_object_glist with s_place
          _free_place_list in function o_complex_prepare_place.

          src/x_console.c: "Fixed" console entry by updating the signal
          name for to that used by the custom entry widget, the "activate"
          signal was previously changed to "process_entry" but was not
          updated in x_console. Changed "destroying history" from fprintf
          to v_log, oops.

          Added more comments source and header files.

        * src/x_clipboard.c: Replaced "on-the-fly" error message dialog
          with new titled_pango_error_dialog and added log message to
          actually record the error in the log.

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Replace x_fileselect_setup_file_filters,
          static struct GschemFileFilterDataDef and initialize macros
          and IDE_FILTER enumerators. The x_fileselect_save function
          now adds ".sch" or "sym", based on the active filter widget,
          but only if there is no period in the file name.

        * include/x_fileselect.h: New file added to reduce filter data
          clutter in corresponding source.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.scm: Added a few stock icons to menu
          entries, some gtk some not, all theme-able.

        * src/x_image.c: Replaced "on-the-fly" error message dialog
          with new titled_pango_error_dialog with minor revision to the
          message. Include <errno.h>, revised error message in function
          x_image_get_pixbuf to include strerror.

        * src/x_menu.c: Modifications to function x_menus_sensitivity
          to implement Verbose and Quite mode variables. Modifications
          to x_menu_setup_popup to check for the existence of valid a
          main menu bar and menu items. Revised x_menu_setup_ui to use
          image menus for actionless items if the icon name is present.

        * src/x_multiattrib.c: Replaced "on-the-fly" error message
          dialog warning_dialog macro, eliminated g_ascii_strcasecmp
          in function multiattrib_callback_edited_name. Revised function
          multiattrib_init to use a struct with a for loop for column
          constructions rather that old in-line one-by-one appoarch.
          Many #define created and utilized to reduce line length and
          compound lines. Eliminated function cellrenderermultilinetext
          _focus_out_event - was extremely annoying.

        * src/x_print.c: Replaced "on-the-fly" error message dialogs
          with new titled_pango_error_dialog.

        * src/x_rc.c: Revised x_rc_parse_gschem_error to cosolidate
          string and handle define dummy function for unbound errs.
          Added function g_rc_unbound_handler, which will return the
          string associated with the last unbound varible or return
          <undefined> if no such value exist. Revamped function x_rc
          _parse_gschem, new algorithms retry loading of RC files.

        * src/o_picture.c: Replaced "on-the-fly" error message dialogs
          with new pango_error_dialog with minor revision to the message
          and include logging of the error.

2013-10-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/o_move: Eliminated function o_move_end_lowlevel_glist,
          the function likely used more code managing the stack than
          the function actually performed.

        * src/x_color.c: Renamed display_outline_colors to outline_colors,
          there is no print_outline_colors so there should be no confusion
          Add x_color_get_outline_color_map().

        * src/x_dialog.c: Added gschem_markup_message_dialog.

        * src/x_edit.c: Eliminated gtk_window_position, gschem_dialog
          will restore the dialog position to last active position.

2013-10-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

          Made prog_pid, the main process ID, a program global, instead
          of a module level global in the undo module.

        * src/ *: Renamed the w_current widgets for the coord labels to
          world_entry & screen_entry.

        * src/o_select.c: Re-write; functions o_select_unselect_all.
          Replaced function o_select_selected with new slightly faster
          "drop-in-replacement" o_select_is_selection and added new
          function o_select_get_count. Made o_select_run_hooks static
          and added local enumerators for SELECT and DESELECT HOOKS.

        * src/x_coord.c: Relocated the code for the Coordinates Dialog
          in x_dialog.c into a separate file but in the same compilation
          unit (at least for now). Renamed x_dialog_coord_display_update
          to x_dialog_coord_update_display -- makes more sense to me.

          src/x_states.h: Added new states; ENDDNDSTR = End D&D String,
          ENDDNDOOBJ, = END D&D Our Object ENDDNDFOBJ = END D&D Foreign
          Object. A Foreign object means from another instance of Gschem,
          only distingished between because dragging in a Foreign defaults
          to a copy, droping natives defaults to moves, maybe haven`t done
          it yet! There is no such distingishment for strings, which can
          only come from Foreign windows. Note that these state pertain to
          dragging TO and dropping on the coordinate world entry widget,
          not the Drawing Area. The DrawingArea has it`s own algorithms
          that do not induce new states, but utilize existing ones. All
          string inputs are processed by algorithms in the DND module.

        * src/x_window.c: Oops, did not finish resolving the visibility
          got side tracked, is now finished, I hope. Cleanup on aisle 5,
          x_window_create_main(). After naming DrawingArea in preivous
          version, forgot to log, renamed widget adding a colon and the
          process id, this is not utilized during runtime but is useful
          when debugging D&D.

2013-10-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/i_command: Added some comments, also in header file.

        * src/x_color.c: Add x_color_get_display_color_map() and x_color_
          get_print_color_map. I think is better than external references.

        * src/x_image.c: Major revisions as follows: Added global static
          integers to retain user settings for image type, image size and
          image extents for the editing session. This is useful since the
          dialog automatically closes after writing images.
          Replaced text combo boxes for image size and type with new geda
          version which eliminates the need for conditional compiling.
          Added two new check box widgets; 1 to optionally use the print
          color map instead of the display color map, and the second button
          to optionally reverse only the Black and White when inverting color
          images. The use Color switch no longer disables the Invert switch.
          Color image can now be inverted by a new function x_image_invert
          _color_buffer. Added two new integer parameters to x_image_get
          _pixbuf and x_image_lowlevel to support the two new options.
          Revised x_image_get_pixbuf function to dynamically allocates the
          memory for "new_w_current" and "toplevel", rather than using static
          declarations for GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL & TOPLEVEL, was 948 bytes.
          x_image_get_pixbuf function now uses it`s own EdaRenderer, with
          new variables GArray color-map, and PangoContext *context. Junction
          and end-point markers are now set to black for B&W imaging, (this
          was needed due to recent upgrades to the EdaRenderer to allow
          additional marker colors. Replaced algorithms in x_image_convert_
          to_greyscale that do the actual conversion.
          Revised x_image_get_type_from_description, which leaked like a
          sieve, maybe fixed now.
          Added tooltips for image size combo, image type combo and the two
          new check buttons.

        * src/x_print.c: Changes in x_print_draw_page to use x_color_get
          _print_color_map, and set makers to black.

        * src/x_settings_dialog.c: Changed all global widgets to static as
          as precautionary measure.

        * src/x_toolbars.c: In function x_toolbar_set_sensitivity, set
          tooltips on or off based on sensitivity of toolbar items.

2013-09-29 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/gschem.c: More tweeking; moved logging and console initialize
          after x_window_setup so that the console/log can be a transient
          child of the main window but this makes the console/log window an
          annoyance that won`t get out of the way, reverted modification to
          src/x_console.c so the dialog does not set the main window as the
          parent. Revised to use new function f_set_backup_loader_query_func

        * src/o_basic.c: Relocated function o_update_component from o_misc.c.
          Revised o_update_component to update the symbol version. Removed
          declaration to external color maps.

        * src/i_vars.c: Added message for Verbose mode, when restoring
          configuration settings in functions; i_vars_init and i_vars_
          recall_user_settings.

        * src/x_basic.c: Added iter time stamp checks in tree_view_row_make
          _visible() and tree_view_row_get_visibility. Does the QT toolkit
          have this kind of crap?

        * src/x_compselect.c: Added check for compselect->style_flag in
          compselect_callback_refresh_views, so that after the refresh the
          routine will stop looking for descendants beyond the second level
          when looking to restore the cursor position in the TreeView.

        * src/x_console.c: Added format specifiers for s_log_message in
          q_log_message and v_log_message to surpress -Wformat-security.

        * src/x_dialog.c: Revise x_dialog_symbol_changed dialog, using code
          from the Master branch, but put the code that creates the "internal"
          widgets into a seperate function: xd_add_changed_symbol_list. Also,
          uses a gtk_message_dialog, not a regular gtk_dialog.

          Added gtk_widget_set_name in function create_geda_switch().

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Revised dialog to be child of main_window if
          w_current was passed.

        * src/various: General clean-up and improved source documentation.

2013-09-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/gschem_struct.h: Eliminate h_adjustment & v_adjustment.
        * src/gschem_toplevel.c: Eliminate h_adjustment & v_adjustment.

        * src/x_console.c: Revised q_log_message & v_log_message to accept a
          variable number of arguments. Revised x_console_init_commands to have
          dynamic messages.

        * src/x_dialog.c: Removed macro DECLARE_TOOPTIPS from x_dialog_fill_type
          _create_dialog, x_dialog_line_type_create_dialog, snap_size_dialog, text_
          size_dialog, and x_dialog_edit_arc_angle because the tooltip widget is
          no longer required and the macros in geda_dialog_controls.h now use gtk_
          widget_set_tooltip_text instead of gtk_tooltips_set_tip.

        * src/x_dnd.c: New source module to support drag & drop;

        * src/x_image.c: Removed macro DECLARE_TOOPTIPS in x_image_setup, see entry
          for x_dialog.c.

        * src/x_autonumber.c, src/x_multiattrib.c, &
          src/x_compselect.c: Replaced gtk_tooltips_set_tip with widget_set_tooltip
          _text

        * src/x_window.c: Changed h_adjustment & v_adjustment to local varibles,
          as these were not used outside of x_window_create_main except in the
          callbacks, which are passed pointers to the controls.

        * src/x_window.h: Created macros to refer to w_current->main_window
          w_current->drawing_area, w_current->h_scrollbar,w_current->v_scrollbar,
          including HorizontalScrollRange and VerticalScrollRange with GTK_RANGE
          cast.

2013-09-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/o_undo.c: Renamed function o_undo_cleanup to finalize. GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL
          as parameter to o_undo_init. Moved call o_undo_init() in gschem.c to after
          the top level is created.

        * src_o_grips: Tested with grip_half_size = GRIP_PIXEL_SIZE / 2, which does
          appear to be an improvment over setting the grip size strickly based on
          the zoom factor. Using a "fixed" grip size was not aesthetically pleasing
          for objects with the line width property set. So the entire scheme was
          replaced with an experimental dynamic grip size system. In this system the
          grip size for redraws is object dependent, and maximized for invalidates.
          At higher zoom levels the grip size for objects can be absolute or based
          on the object`s width and the zoom factor.

        * src/x_compselect.c: Added parent property to g_object_new in function
          x_compselect_open. Removed gtk_window_set_transient_for since parent
          object will make the call to lib, see changes to gschem_dialog below.

        * src/x_multiattrib.c: Added parent property to g_object_new in function
          x_multiattrib_open. Removed gtk_window_set_transient_for since parent
          object will make the call to glib, see changes to gschem_dialog below.

        * src/x_compselect.c: Added parent property to g_object_new in function
          x_compselect_open. Removed gtk_window_set_transient_for since parent
          object will make the call to glib, see changes to gschem_dialog below.

        * src/gschem_dialog.c: Add new properties PROP_PARENT_WINDOW and PROP_TITLE,
          with supporting functions; gschem_dialog_get_parent, gschem_dialog_
          set_parent, gschem_dialog_get_title and gschem_dialog_set_title.

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Add checkbox with option to append "sch" on the file
          name of the user so elects. The file extension is not added if file already
          has an "dot extension". The option is save to the user config settings.

        * src/x_settings.c: Added new function x_settings_save_settings to save misc
          user configurable settings. Maybe should just move all of the "save settings"
          to this function to bettter organize the code.

        * src/x_settings_dialog.c: Added new widgets and variables for grip size,
          color, fill color, text markers, size and color, net enpoint color, junction
          size and color. Added new functions for popup menu to restore default colors.
          Added check in function GatherSettings for a change to w_current->scrollbars_
          visible when retrieved, and update the widgets so that a re-start is not
          required when changing this setting.

        * src/x_windows.c: removed  * char* group from save and restore settings
          functions, renamed both function "settings" instead of "geometry".
          renamed function x_window_create_drawing x_window_create_drawing_area and
          made static, removed from prototype.h.

        * Added New Deselect mode: i_command/menu/toolbar renamed deselect action to
          deselect-all, added new action deselect. In x_states.h added DESELECT and
          STARTDESELECT. Added status string in i_basic.c->i_status_string. Added
          DESELECT & STARTDESELECT to button press event handlers in x_events.c. In
          Added STARTDESELECT in o_basic.c->o_redraw_cleanstates(), which does nothing.
          In o_select.c->o_select_object reversed CONTROLKEY if deselecting.

          P.S: De-select could use improvement, this does not work by "windowing".
          Objects to be removed must be selected indivualy. The user could hold the
          "ctrl" key and do this but maybe is still an improvement.

2013-09-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * Applied numerous changes based on changes in the Master branch. Attempted
          to provide the same functionality in the Rampage branch but I was behind on
          updates, and have ignored most of the dialog updates, until I can re-examine
          these. Most of the recent updates to dialogs do no involve functionality and
          most all of the dialogs in the Rampage branch have already under gone
          extensive revisions.

          Implemented "Reset refdes number to the question mark when parts are copied"
          equivalent to the functionality added in the master branch with commit
          7dafcd5e30e957dc1fffbb2eedae5d1a555a6552. The "feature" was later reverted
          with commit f28e4db09bb6ee732976e03b6b342c085fbb828b due to potential data
          loss, presumably reference designators. I did not revert because the version
          implemented in Rampage used different algorythms and I could not detect any
          data losses. (When the feature was impletmented, the feature was tested with
          with various ref-des formats; such as RL0911 and ZZZ1.). Perhaps someones is
          using a format that I am not familiar with.

        * src/o_buffer.c: Set flag for page changed in function o_buffer_cut.

        * src/i_command: Major changes; added int x and int y to command_struc, added
          new ActionFlags using bits 2 and 3. None of the threads use the new bit 2,
          which is a fallback to in-line mode. When bit 3 of the Action flag is set,
          i_command_process captures the cursor X-Y position to the new members or
          zero`s both if x_event_get_pointer_position returns false. Bit 3 is set for
          each action potentially responding to Hot-key or Right-Mouse input, where
          the cursor position is relevant. This was done in i_command_process rather
          then repeating the same blocks of code or adding function calls in each of
          the action handlers that would use this feature. Within the action handlers
          the new HOT_ACTION macro is used to determine if the X-Y input should be
          used. More of the code (for hot-keys) in i_callback was moved over this
          module

          Added function msg_need_select_1st() so that the string MSG_SELECT_OBJECT_1ST
          would not allocated in multible action handlers.

          Added new action zoom-selection, and no we did not have this before.

        * src/x_icons.c: Major changes, see revision notes in the source file.

        * src/gschem.c: Eliminated call to x_window_set_default_icon. This is now
          called a little later in a new function: x_icons_initialize(), which is
          called from x_window_setup().

        * gschem_action: Revised to include icon-id property, see revision notes in
          the source file.

        * src/x_menus.c: Numerous revisions, revised popup structure to include tips
          and icons. Revised x_menu_setup_popup to eliminated depreciated item factory.
          Added new GSLIST member to menu data structure for popup menu widgets and
          associated reference macro POPUP_ITEMS_LIST. Eliminated global int npopup_
          items, which was only used by the item_factory. Added two new menu options
          for toggling of icons and tips on the context menu. Revised function x_menu_
          popup_execute, which now retrieve a pointer to the top-level w_current data
          structure from the widget. Changed menu_icons_toggle and menu_tips_toggle to
          radio type.

          Added variable menus_broken in x_menu_setup_ui. The variable is used to
          suppress redundant error messages and does not otherwise effect the menus.
          Added index varible to the error message to facilitate locating invalid
          menu data.

          Added the two new toolbars to the view/toolbars submenu.

          Updated documentation in the source file.

        * src/g_action: New source file from master branch, relocated i_process_action
          to this file and re-named g_process_action.

        * src/x_basic.c: Updated source documentation.

        * src/x_dialog.c: Aded new experimental feature by enhancing the Coord dialog,
          changing World label to a Text Entry widget, which allows entering of coor-
          dinates. Upon activating, by pressing "enter" the cursor is repostioned to
          the given coordinate relative to the drawing area. Say YEA! (I like it)

        * src/x_event.c: Added new function: x_event_set_pointer_position to support
          enhancments to the Coord dialog.

        * src/x_menus.h: Relocated structure definition for popup menu entry from
          the source to the header and added type definition, to reduce clutter in
          the source file. Revised the popup entry data structure to include the
          callback function, pointer to icon name and tooltips. Added defines for
          menu toggle paths because these are referenced in three place; creation,
          saving and restoring.

        * include/gschem_idefines.h: Eliminated defines for selected from "HOTKEY"
          and "MENU". Replaced in sources with ID_ORIGIN_KEYBOARD and ID_ORIGIN_MENU.


2013-09-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/prototype.h: fix typo o_net_finishmagnetic->o_net_finish_magnetic

        * src/ *.c: Replaced GTK_WIDGET_SET_FLAGS with equivenlent gtk function in
          x_window.x, function x_window_create_drawing, x_dialog, function x_dialog
          _create_search_replace_dialog and x_settings_dialog.c, function create_
          settings_dialog, also replace g_widget_show with g_object_set.

2013-09-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/parsecmd.c: Added --safe-mode and associated global varible run_mode.

        * src/gschem.c: Added conditional directive for g_thread_init -> glib<2.32
          Added call to XInitThreads().

        * src/x_edit_pin.c: Relocate pin-type dialog from x-dialog to a seperate
          file and revamped again. Add accessibility and tool tips and improved
          handling of widget senitivities. Convert gtk_labels to geda_labels and
          consolidated many strings to module level string structure. Added 2nd
          table for over-ride switch, lots of code cleaning.

2013-08-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x_attribedit.c: Added function callback_attrib_entry_activate to
          advance focus from the Name Combo/Entry to the Value entry and added
          gtk_combo_box_set_focus_on_click because it was really annoying when
          after selecting an attribute from the combo, the Value entry text was
          selected, but the Value widget did not have focus. Gtk erronously
          generates the "changed" signal for every keypress and a change of the
          selection in the combo`s tree. Added tooltip and atk objects to this
          dialog.

        * src/widgets/geda_font_dialog.c: New replacement widget for gtkchooser
          dialog, which is not actually in gtk2, and corresponding header file.

        * src/widgets/gschem_font_button.c: New replacement widget for gtkfontsel
          with corresponding header file.

        * src/widgets/geda_label.c: New replacement widget for gtklabel.

        * remark: The preceding widgets were replaced in order to diagnose and
          eliminate a memory leak. Gtk is having Pango use FontConfig to find
          a best match font, between Pango and FontConfig a block of memory is
          not being released after the widgets are destroyed. After "pin-point-
          ing" the leak, more than 40 hours later, may be able to work-around
          the leak by super-classing but already done. Replacement widgets are
          a work-around, but also offer improved performance (according to rusage),
          few errors in libraries (according to valgrind) and is cleaner code
          (according to me).

        * src/x_edit_text.c: Separated the Text Editing dialog code to a new
          compilation unit. (This was when the aforementioned memory leak was
          detected.)

2013-07-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/globals.h: Added another macro: Top_Selection, only useful
          to reduce line lengths:

        * src/gschem.c: In function main_prog(), eliminated call to g_thread
        _init. GTK claims this is no longer necessary. (Reverted this using
        conditional compilation)

        * src/i_basic.c: Set sensitivity for editing and clipboard items.
        Fixed sensitivities for Unembed Component/Picture and popup items.
        Sensitivities are now more accurate.

        * src/i_command.c: In function do_documentation, eliminated call to
        g_type_init, GTK claims this is no longer necessary. Libgeda make
        this call during initialization.

        * src/o_select.c: Applied Top_Selection macro to reduce line lengths
        and general code clean up. In function o_select_object(), added
        varible Selection = marco Current_Selection, to reduce broken lines
        and improve readability.

        * src/x_dialog.c: Added/revised documentation in source code. In
        function x_dialog_text_input_apply, changed == '\0' to != '\0' in
        order to eliminate unnecessary early "return".

        * src/x_icons.c: Added icon "geda_new"

        * src/x_menus.c: Added Cut, Copy, Paste to the mouse popup menu.
        Changed Copy Mode to Duplicate. Updated function documentation.

        Performed bug tests using reported bugs from launchpad.net/geda...
        [Note these are bugs reported for the main trunk not ours]
        Bug: #732326, Description <gschem segfaults on recursive loop>
             result: Does not crash, gschem reports the symbols does not exist.
        Bug: #900122, Description <gschem crashes on ctrl-x>
             result: Could not reproduce, no errors encountered.


2013-05-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x_windows.c: Added conditional in x_window_restore_geometry
        to set the default width and height to DEFAULT_WINDOW_WIDTH and
        DEFAULT_WINDOW_HEIGHT if values were not return from configuration.

        * src/widgets/geda_handlebox.c: Added marshaler for "child-attached"
        and "child-detached", g_cclosure_marshal_VOID__BOOLEAN, because GTK
        complained, (on Mint distro) that there was no marshler.

        * src/x_settings_dialog.c: Ported default-filename, default-titleblock
        to new configuration system.

        * include/keywords.h: Removed untitled_name

2013-05-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/Makefile.am: Change -I$(abs_top_builddir)/include to
        -I$(top_srcddir)/include. Don`t know where i got abs_top_build.
        Does not work for distcheck or on Mint (and probably Ubuntu) with
        automake ver? autoconf v?

        * include/Makefile.am: Addded include widgets/Makefile_insert in
        order to build out-of-source for distro checks.
        * src/x_compselect.c:
        * include/widgets/Makefile_insert: New file, see previous entry.

2013-04-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        Comments: It seems like one aspects that seems to be "handicapping"
        the geda-gaf project is the "immature" libraries. So I have striven
        to add new symbols in "bulk" and much more work is needed, partic-
        ularly for modern integrated circuits. The Component Selection dia-
        log was one of Gschem`s best and most sophisticated dialogs but as
        more symbols were added to the library an even more elaborate sys-
        tems was necessary. This "experimental" release along with the March
        2013 release have primarily been devoted to improving this situation.
        I think the library can now be expanded but field testing is needed
        to "polish" the new schemes. (Maybe a library manager is needed.)

        * src/x_basic.c: Added functions tree_view_row_get_visibility and
        tree_view_row_make_visible.

        * src/widgets/geda_menu_button.c: New source for Menu Button Widget.
        The widget is similar to GtkMenuToolButton but is more versatile in
        terms of configurability and, more importantly, is not derived from
        GtkToolButton. The widget is not sub-classed but is instead derived
        from GtkEventBox because the "action-appearance" property does not
        appear to be responsive for GtkToolButton derivatives. The new widget
        could use improvements, maybe put button inside alignment widgets
        but seems functional and stable.

        * src/x_compselect.c: Another re-vamp as follows: Behavior button
        relocated to custom action area, aka on the same row as the "close"
        and "okay" button. A new Menu Button widget was added to the left of
        GtkOptionMenu Behavior combo. The GtkMenuToolButton`s disappearing
        button pre-light was not consistence with the steady combo outline
        so the new Menu Button widget was invented. The Menu button contains
        a new "style" check menu which is used to filter displaying of -x.sym
        files in tree-views where x = 1 through 8. The main button performs
        the previous "refresh" function but is now called "rescan".
        A new pop-up menu was added to the right mouse button for the tree
        views and is also accessible with <shift>-F10. The menu includes a
        styles submenu and other features. One feature that I really like is
        the ability to close a tree without having to scroll up to the parent.
        (This was not needed before but now there are symbol folders with more
        than 300 symbols, so this feature might come in handy.)
        Tool-tips added through-out the dialog, with the tips in tree-views
        being enabled or disabled from the new mouse menu.

        New algorithms were added for refreshing of the library tree-views
        so that any previously selected row is centered in the views after
        the model is replaced because it was really annoying when the view
        was refreshed with the non-labeled, tip-less "refresh" button and all
        opened folders would collapse because the model was replaced in the
        view. The new algorithms locate the folders, sub-folders and selected
        symbol and re-centers the new view of the tree on the selection. If
        the previously selected symbol is no longer in the view because it`s
        style was turned off then the first symbol matching the name without
        considering the -x.sym characters, is selected instead. See new
        function compselect_callback_refresh_views. (This was a lot of work!)

        A custom signal is emitted with the style is changed and all of the
        tree-views are automatically "refreshed" so the "refresh" button or
        menu option shouldn`t really be needed.

        Note: With this new scheme, different symbol style sources may or may
        not be loaded into memory when gschem starts. Those that are, may or
        may not be visible in the trees-views of the component selection dia-
        log. In the new context, "Refreshing" meaning rebuilding the models
        based on the current "group" and "sub-group" settings and populating
        the trees with the symbols that are in memory.

        Added module level globals to check "settings" variables. The settings
        are only written to the key file if the value changed. A new procedure,
        compselect_settings_restore, was added to obtain settings from the
        keyfile before the dialog is constructed, this will of course need to
        be revised once the main branch figures out what to do about a config
        systems.

        Added conditional call to compselect_refresh_inuse_view in on_notebook
        _switch_page (so now, unless I am mistaked, manual refreshing is not
        really needed).

        Consolidated some dialog string to DialogStrings structure and added
        much documentation. (I am sure there was more but tired now, must rest.)

2013-03-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/globals.c: Move global force_save_as to w_current->force_save_as

        * src/x_dialog.c: Added conditional in select_all_text_in_textview to
        check for valid GtkTextView pointer.


2013-03-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x_compselect.c: Mostly re-vamp as follows: Added notebook tabs
        for manufactures, simulation and local. Revised supporting functions
        to support multiple tree-views. Switch/toggle buttons added for groups
        and subgroup which is supported by the new trees-store. Added collapse
        and expand all. Implemented macros from geda_dialog_controls.h to help
        reduce "cluttered" sections, (could use more). New variables mantreeview,
        simtreeview, localtreeview, notebook, applying_filter, show_groups,
        subgroups and active_tab. Renamed (many) variables and functions in order
        to improve readability. Added two (non-visible) columns to the Library
        tree views, 1 for enumerated data types to support nested structures and
        1 for tool-tips. Added tool-tips through-out. Converted combo-box to check
        menu for consistency with other dialogs, (probably need to derive widget
        class someday since GtkOptionMenu is depreciated (don`t care, GTK as a
        whole is depreciated). Dialog uses new toplevel glist variable to obtain
        group data even though this isn`t really required. It does provide users
        with more flexibility in controlling how component library information is
        displayed. Function x_compselect_close, was eliminated. New Property
        PROP_VIEW added. General clean-up and improved documentation.

        * src/g_util.c: Added new utility functions g_copy_tree_iter and
        g_list_find_string.

2013-02-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/gschem_dialog.c: Add new property PROP_SELECTION_TRACKER, with
          supporting functions; gd_connect_selection, gd_disconnect_selection
          gd_callback_selection_finalized, gd_callback_selection_changed. This
          callback system is similar to the ones in the multiattrib dialog but
          is implemented in a more general way.

        * src/x_dialog.c: Reorganized code and updated documentation. Revised
          text_edit_dialog to accept OBJECT, (which then passed the same object to
          the response function rather than w_current.) Added data hook for colorcombo
          and text alignment, eliminating callback for change_alignment. Unneeded
          change_alignment function was removed because the alignment was being
          changed when the combo widget selection was changed, even though the
          OK-Button was not pressed. Revised response function text_edit_dialog
          _response to accept the OBJECT *object as the third parameter and renamed
          parameter 1 "dialog" insead of "w", derived w_current from GSCHEM_DIALOG
          inheritance. General re-vamp for text_edit_dialog_ok revised: Change
          parameters to accept OBJECT *object, retrieve alignment and color from
          tree models using GTK data hooks,  Change dialog to modeless and relocate
          to new "editing" group, add update on selection change. Revised to
          eliminate conditional construction of the "text" editing buffer, which is
          set to an empty value if multiable text objects are selected.
          Revised with similar changes for color_edit_dialog, x_dialog_edit_arc_angle,

          Created tooltips: snap_size_dialog, text_size_dialog, x_dialog_edit_arc_angle
          x_dialog_edit_color, x_dialog_fill_type, x_dialog_edit_line.

          Added new utility function x_dialog_get_list_selected_objects, see description
          in source module.

          Completely re-vamp x_dialog_edit_pin_type.

          removed CHANGE and UNDO from response handler in text_size_dialog, and
          text_size_dialog.

        * include/x_dialog.h: Relocated widtget data structures for line_type_data,
          fill_type_data from source to this header, prefix with st_ and added type
          definitions. Added new struction for pin data. Added new macro DECLARE_
          TOOPTIPS.

        * src/x_autonumber.c: Changed ScopeNumberCombo and ScopeSkipCombo to menus as
          variables ScopeNumberMenu and ScopeSkipMenu. The check menus are consistence
          with other dialogs, so this helps improve uniformity of dialogs interfaces.
          The Combo menus use a common creator function: create_scope_menu. Reverted
          conditional check for inheritance in function autonumber_remove_number because
          s_slot_search_slot really does return both inherited and non-inherited attributes.
          Added type difinition for anynomous enumerator now AutoNumberScope and change
          the varibles autonumber_text_t; scope_number and scope_skip, to use new type.
          renamed functions: autonumber_get_state to retrieve_values_from_dialog, and
          autonumber_set_state to restore_dialog_values. Some updates to documentation.

        * src/o_misc.c: Function o_edit; added case for OBJ_BOX, OBJ_LINE, OBJ_CIRCLE
          Changed PIN type to separate case and made launch conditional based on the
          whether page is a symbol or a schematic.
          Removed un-used definition FIND_WINDOW_HALF_SIZE.

        * src/o_slot.c: attempted to update function documentation.

        * src/o_text:Added OBJ_TEXT conditional in o_text_edit and pass OBJECT
          rather than individual members of OBJECT *o_current to text_edit_dialog.
          Revised o_text_edit_end: Adding text_color, changed_something conditionals
          and documentation.

        * src/x_toolbars.c: Added new toolbar items: edit attributes, edit arc, edit
          pin, edit slot.

        * include/globals.h: Add new macro Current_Selection to help reduce coding
          lines lengths.

        * remove multible occurance of exit(-1), exiting is not cool, functions need
          to handle errors more robustly.

2013-02-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x_toolbars.c: Added new toolbar items: Edit Text, Show Hidden.

        * src/i_command.c: added verbose message to function attach, detach, show_value,
          do_show_name, and do_show_both to better info the user.

        * src/i_command.h: Changed do_paste_clip to type USE_WORKER_THREAD.

2013-02-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/g_register.c: Mostly re-vamp; Split up static structure for subroutines
          into three; gschem_rc_funcs, gschem_g_funcs, gschem_hk_funcs, eliminating non-
          hot-key callbacks to help reduce Scheme-C-Scheme-C-Scheme-C discombobulation.
          Revised function g_register_funcs to use the new structures and to obtain a
          list of actions to register from i_command_get_action_list.

        * src/i_command.c: New file with experimental code to (mostly) replace i_callback.c
          This scheme uses a single function "i_command_process" to respond to all actions
          regardless of the origin. Most, if not all of the old i_callback.c functions,
          that were not hot-key actions, were revised and relocated to this module.
          The central interface function i_command_process also manages repeat-last action.
          The action file-close now uses the same algorithms as page-close so gschem no
          longer "exits" when the last document is closed, instead a new empty document is
          created (like a "normal" program). (That was so annoying!)

        * src/i_callback.c: Removed nearly all functions that were not hot-key actions.
          The hot-key handlers could really be moved to i_command_process but other than
          capturing X-Y, the handlers mostly contain redundant code, so need to digress
          on these.

        * src/o_delete.c: Replaced local dialog with gschem_confirm_dialog.

        * src/x_stroke.c: modified x_stroke_translate_and_execute to use i_command_process.

        * src/x_menu.c: Major modifications to this module; Added additional toggle actions;
          menu icons, global toolbar style, scrollbars visibility and toggling menu tips.
          Add menu tooltips for menu items. Add glist for menu_items, a collection of all
          menu_items. Window specific widgets list, such as menu_items, were put in a
          static list of structures indexed on a per window basis. Added new function
          x_menu_free_all to free the aforementioned structure when a windows is closed.

        * src/x_icons.c:  Added an icon factory! Should maybe have done this a long
          time ago, this makes using bitmaps much easier. Maybe wrong place though,
          1 file for 40 or so lines seems a waste. Could expand by relocating stray
          bitmap routines and consolidate into one file or move to some to
          miscellaneous, dunno.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.scm: Added tooltip and icon id`s to menu list.
          New section 'General System Options' added with new keywords "show-menu-icons"
          and "toolbars-mode", relocated related keywords to this new section.
          New section 'Scrollbar Options' added with new keyword scrollbars-visible.
          The scrollbars-visible variable provide a simple solution to resolve issue
          with the scrollbars being required for mousing pan. The scrollbars are still
          present, just not visible and this allows for mouse panning.
          Added Stroke Letter O for Open.
          Some keys re-assigned and action names revised as necessary to implement unified
          actions scheme described in i_command above.
          Added invert selection menu item.

        * src/gschem_dialog.c: Relocated DIALOG_GEOMETRY_STORE to /include/sdefines.h

        * include/sdefines.h: Created WINDOW_GEOMETRY_STORE.

        * include/gschem_struct.h: Added new w_current variables pointer_hscroll,
          scrollbars_visible, and ui_index.

        * src/x_events.c: Revised function x_event_scroll to incoorperate
          new w_current variable pointer_hscroll.

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Added thread protection in x_fileselect_load_backup

        * src/x_window.c: Function x_window_open_page: re-vamp; removed g_run_hook_page
          from x_window_open_page, this assumed user was creating a new schematic and
          not a new symbol, (and this was really annoying because it not only made the
          assumption, the hook also locked the titleblock. The hook was added to action
          "page-new" but not to "file-new" in i_command action handlers. All new flow
          is more robust when errors encounted during loading. Message dialog replaced
          with fprintf to stderr because some messages returned from o_read_buffer may
          not be suitable for pango.

          Added function x_window_save_geometry to preserve the state of the main
          window similar to preservation of dialog geometry.

        * src/g_util.c: rename free_string_glist g_list_free_string

        * src/g_rc.c: x_dialog.c Add alternative_button_order to generic_confirm_dialog
          renamed "generic_" to "gschem_" for confirm_dialog and message_dialog
          Added argumenent gEDA_MessageType context and char *title to message_dialog.
          Added new function g_rc_pointer_hscroll.

        * src/globals.c: Added new variable 'force_save_as' as a flag for the save
          routine. The flag is set true if the loader, x_window_open_page detects a
          filespec the user does not have permission to create.

        * include/globals.h: Add Utility Macros for Message Dialogs, Added enumerators
          ID_COMMAND_ORIGIN and extern reference to new global 'force_save_as'.

        * scripts/gschem.scm: In function invalid-action-error; changed error to gschem-msg
          because this was crashing gschem when a valid key sequence was pressed that was
          assigned to a non-existence function. The function eval-keymap-action now reports
          the invalid keybinding via a dialog without crashing. Also in eval-keymap-action,
          the action is now tested for a thunk or a procedure and if is a procedure the
          procedure is passed the action string. This allows a common call back for all key
          bindings rather then having to define a seperate function for every key assignment.

        * src/m_basic.c: Revised SCREENabs to return 0 if w_current or toplevel or
          page_current is NULL. Revised mil_x, mil_y, pix_x and pix_y to 1.) return 0 if
          w_current or toplevel or page_current is NULL with error message, 2. use local
          variables for x_constant, y_constant,y_constant y_constant and height.
          world_y_constant 3.) Eliminated int i.

        * src/o_grips.c: o_grips_size: error message if w_current or toplevel or
          page_current is NULL and MAXIMUM_GRIP_PIXELS/2

        * include/x_toolbars.h: New file

        * src/toolbars.c: Modified the toolbar module to use i_command_process, added
          single point callback that retrieves the action name from the widgets. A
          separate callback is used for toolbar radios. New macros were created
          for toolbar radios. The "mode" buttons, and the "mode" feature is complete
          for all of what is perceived to be the original "ADD" modes. The toolbar radios
          were put into a single group. i_update_toolbar was removed from "everywhere",
          this one seems to have gotten out of hand, and was being call recursively.
          The toolbars now retain their style, along with visibility between sessions.
          A context/dock senitive popup was added to the toolbars to set various options
          including auto docking of the toolbars. The orientation, which can be changed
          while floating, is restored to the "home" orientation before re-docking.
          [The gtk handlebox widget has a "Private" feature to do this with a mouse click
          but this did not appear to work and needs to be fixed]. Mean time, the popup
          menu provides sufficient functionality. (is still 2 mouse-clicks just different
          buttons.)  Changed toolbar list from static and put in new structure
          ToolBarWidgets, added static list ui_list in order for all of the toolbar
          widgets to be tracked on a per window basis. Added function x_toolbars_free_window
          to free the aforemention structure when a window is closed.

          * src/widgets/geda_handlebox.c and associated header: This is an adaptation
          of the gtkhandlebox in it`s entirety, not a derived sub-class. The reason
          for this is because gtk has declared gtkhandlebox depreciated (do to lack
          lack of functionality). The gnome docker is better but this would impose
          additional linkage. If we wanted to link to a new library just for toolbars
          then there are multiple options, GDL seems to be the front-runner.
          Given the current implementation in our toolbar module we have adequate
          functionality, for now, and we did not incur any new dependencies, not even
          GTK3. The only major "toolbar feature" offered in other modern programs is
          "customization". This could be easily added using the current linkage, and
          perhaps should be added since all of the gtk_toolbar_??pend_item/element
          class functions have been depreciated in favor of gtk_toolbar_insert, which
          is less convenient and requires more effort to implement. It seems that it
          would be easier to replace gtk_toolbar`s rather then use the new ones.

          That`s most of the major stuff! Wiley

2013-01-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/g_rc.c: Relocated g_rc_bus_ripper_symname from libgeda to gschem
          to consolidate the Ripper variables. Changed ripper Rotation and Type
          values to strings defined with macros in gschem_sdefined.h because these
          string have to match what is written by x_settings.c.

        * src/ *.c: Revised as needed for relocation of bus_ripper_symname variable

        * include/gschem_sdefined.h: Added Bus Ripper Strings

        * src/x_image.c: Add 3 Toggle "Switch" button, 1 for imaging Extents/Display
          1 for Color or B/W, 1 to Invert B/W images. Implemented new toplevel
          variables image_color and invert_images.

        * include/globals.h: Reversed Image_Display and Image_All enumeration for
          semantics with new switches on the Write Image Dialog.

        * src/x_settings.c: Completed code on handlers for Bus Ripper variables.

        * src/x_settings_dialog.c: Added spinner RipperSize, switches Ripper
          Rotation, RipperType, and combo RipperSymbol for Bus Ripper variables,
          and associated code for loading and unloading the widgets.

2012-12-29 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x_log.c: Added functions; q_log_message and v_log_message, to
          facilitate honoring of the quiet_mode and verbose_mode, respectively.
          Both command-line switches appear to have been ignored for the last
          14 years!

        * src/(various).c: Changed some "chatter" messages to new q_log_message
          function.

        * src/gschem_dialog.c: Removed conditional from destroy_with_parent in
          the function gschem_dialog_new_empty. No Children should stay open
          when main window is destroyed.

        * src/x_windows.c: Revised function x_window_close eliminating all of the
          gtk_widget_destroy(w_current->sowindow). These were unessacary becasue
          they should all have attribute GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT.

        * src/i_basic.c: Renamed i_update_menus to i_update_ui and added
          conditionals for setting somewhat more selective menu and toolbar
          senisitivies. Previously the only real criteria was whether something
          was selector or not. Added new functions selected_complex_object.
          (probably could do more here.)

        * src/toolbars.c: Added Save and Restore functionality to toolbar. At
          this point only visibility is retained. The new functions use a key
          file simular to the dialogs geometry. Attempted to use new EDACONFIG
          but this did not work out. (Maybe a few wringles still?)

2012-12-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * all-source-files: Were effectively changed by changing what headers are
          included in gschem.h. Inclusion of all of the dialog related headers
          was reorganized. This departs from the apparent "include every" approach
          used by nearly all source files (but not all). The majority of source
          files included headers for dialogs that was simply wasting compiler
          time. More needs to be done to organized the source files as the
          complexity of the programs grows.

        * tree: Revised source structure adding the widget folders under both
          the include and the source directories in order to better organize
          the source files and headers as the number of file is ever increasing.

        * src/x_menu.c: Revised get_main_menu function, changing the toggle
          options to menu toggle action object with new GedaToggleAction
          type (so the accelorators would be added to the menu). Added support
          routines for Toolbar and Menu Toggle (a lot of work!).

        * src/widget/geda_toggle_action.c: New file.

        * src/i_callbacks.c: Added callback documentation for c api for component
          documentation, which was eliminated and the menu redirected to schema
          code. The callback is a new version that uses g_app_info_launch_default_for_uri
          rather than the misplaced initiate_gschemdoc function, (an improved version
          of which now resides in x_misc.c). The new codes include commented code to
          use x_show_uri function which does spawn a browser but this does work on
          (pure) Debian Linux, and potentialy on derivative machines, due to an issue
          related to debian-gnome configurations that has nothing to do with geda code.
          g_app_info_launch_default_for_uri seems to work REALLY well.
          Why C interface was replaced with SCM is beyond me, are we forgetting that
          we are a C program and that Guild is for "extensions" not for core routines.
          This would be like replacing Excel`s internal C++ routines with Visual Basic
          equivalents. Must keep "extension" in context.

2012-12-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x_windows.c: Revised x_window_create_main, added center_hbox,
          center_vbox, moved drawing box to center_vbox with horizontial
          scroll, to support new toolbars.

2012-12-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * lib/user-gschemrc.scm: Added new configuration file excerpted from
          from system-gschemrc.scm. Configuration keywords and options not
          supported by the main configuration dialog in x_settings_dialog.c
          were excluded from this new file. The file is installed to the same
          location as system-gschemrc.scm. Routines to save configuration
          settings read this file as a template if a gschemrc file is not
          found in the users home directory. The new file is not written to,
          nor is the file read during program initialization. Added new
          variable invert_images.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.scm: Changed (define autoplace-attribute-grid
          50) to (attribute_placement_grid 50) to avoid name conflict.
          autoplace-attribute-grid was a function that processed the RC entry
          and was re-defined as a scm symbol with an integer value by the
          entry in the RC file. This meant autoplace-attribute-grid could not
          be read twice while processing xxx-gschemrc files without an error.

        * src/ *.c & include/ *.h: Implemented renaming of autoplace_attribute
          _grid to attribute_placement_grid in various files. Added RC support
          for new top-level variable invert_images.

        * src/x_settings.c: Added new function x_settings_set_scm_int; could
          not find in libgeda. Revised function generate_rc to use the template
          rc file and to write to the user`s home directory. This resolves the
          implementation issues on Linux system associated with permissions of
          /etc/geda. Added handling for new invert_images variable, (image-
          color was setup with inital release of this file but was not setup in
          x_settings_dialog.c. Added missing line-feeds messages in generate_rc

        * src/g_funcs.c: Revised calls to x_image_lowlevel in g_funcs_image to
          include new parameter.

        * src/g_rc.c: Added call in g_rc_attribute_placement_grid to function
          x_settings_set_scm_int to define autoplace-attribute-grid

        * src/i_callbacks.c: Added new DEFINE_T_CALLBACK, revised DEFINE_I_
          CALLBACK to eliminated gpointer to data. Revised all callback
          functions by eliminating unnecessary conversion of gpointer to
          GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL and eliminated all g_return_if_fail(w_current !=
          NULL). The callbacks are either from menu or toolbar widgets, a few
          of the toolbar callbacks call menu callbacks and the arguments are
          defined with a single g_signal_connect in x_menu.c so the only way
          w_current will be null is if someone modified the x_menu.c code or
          calls a menu handler, which should not happen and if this does happen
          then gscehm should crash-&-burn so it will be fixed! There is nothing
          a "user" can do that would cause w_current to be null in callbacks.
          Revised callback for view_zoom_box to include a call to o_select_
          unselect_all because this did not work from the menu if anything
          as selected, there appears to be a signal handling issue.
          Added i_callback_toolbar_file_save_as for new toolbar control.
          Added i_callback_toolbar_file_print for new toolbar control.
          Added i_callback_toolbar_write_pdf for new toolbar control.
          Added i_callback_toolbar_clipboard_cut for new toolbar control.
          Added i_callback_toolbar_clipboard_copy for new toolbar control.
          Added i_callback_toolbar_clipboard_paste for new toolbar control.

          Updated function documentation

        * src/x_image.c: Revised x_image_get_pixbuf to implement new variable
          invert_images. The revisions effectively resolves Launchpad 1086530
          and extends functionality of gschem. Corrected function name in log
          message in function x_image_write_eps. Added write to PDF image type
          and repaired postscript in f_print.c. Added ImageTypeStrings to
          set the initial combo image type instead of hard-code #define and
          revised function create_type_menu so code could set the value, such
          as toolbar or menus could set default type.

        * src/x_settings_dialog.c: Add call in function GatherSettings to
          x_settings_set_scm_int to define autoplace-attribute-grid. Added
          switch for new top-level variable invert_images. Relocated Notify
          Events switch to the edit tab, replacing a spare switch location.
          Rearranged widgets on rows 1, 2 & 3, and created new row 4 to make
          room for invert_images, image-color switches. Changed w_current->
          draw_grips to w_current->renderer->draw_grips, this was also done
          in all other remaining instances of draw_grips, like in o_grips.c
          and o_basic.c, etc., to support the new lib libgedacairo.la.

2012-11-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/x_dialog_controls.h: relocated this recent addition to
          toplevel include folder so other apps, like gattrib could also
          reference this file and renamed to geda_dialog_controls.h
        * src/o_delete.c:

2012-11-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

          relocated functions get_geda_switch_image and
          create_geda_switch from x_settings.c to incorperate in other
          dialog compilations.
        * src/o_slot.c: Revised error slot number out of range message
          in o_slot_end functions to include to the actual number that
          was passed - new_slot_number. (should o_slot_end really report
          slot=0 as invalid or should it just be ignored? slot=0 means
          there are no slots and this IS VALID according to web-site!)
        * src/x_multiattrib.c: General revisions, changed toggle button
          for Show Inherited to toggle switch for Dialog uniformity.
          Implemented limited tooltips.
        * src/x_autonumber.c: General revisions incoorperating macros
          in x_dialog_controls.h, changing toggle buttons to toggle
          switches. Implemented tooltips.
        * lib/system-gschemrc.scm: Change lines width settings. Moved
          menu option "edit-show-hidden" from edit menu to the view
          (changing hot key from "E N" to "V A" [for View Attributes
          or ALL]) to improve menu balence, (the Edit menu was too long
          for some display configurations) and the View menu seems a more
          appropriate place for this function.

2012-09-17 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x_settings.c: Add new source file.
        * include/x_settings.h: Add new source file.
        * src/x_settings_dialog.c: Add new source file configure_settings.
        * include/x_settings_dialog.h: Added new header file.
        * include/keywords.h: Add new header file to support x_settings.c.
        * include/x_dialog_controls.h: Add new header file. This is a
          barrage of macros for GTK Dialogs.
        * /include: Where is top-level change log? Revised directory
          structure to include a global folder for common inclusions.
        * src/Makefile.am: Revised to include new header folder and added
          variables INC_GEDA, INC_LOCAL, INC_LIBGEDA, and GEDA_INCLUDES,
          so that the search paths would be more concise. This also fixes
          a problem with a redundant search.
        * lib/system-gschemrc: Extensive revisions to cleanup, document,
          and group related keywords.
        * src/ *: Seem like much more was done, why are the git Changelogs
          not used?

2012-07-22 Sergey Alyoshin <alyoshin.s@gmail.com> Added notify on locked
          items deletion to resolve bug lp-1027596.

2012-06-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x_autonumber.c: relocated lookup_widget from to src/x_dialog.c
        * src/x_dialog.c: revised lookup_widget to log widget not found
        * src/x_log.c: added destroy_with_parent to x_log_open function. The
          log window was not always being closed when gschem crashed.
        * src/ *.c: replaced depreciated g_strcasecmp with function
          g_ascii_strcasecmp
        * src/ *: Made temporary repairs to logging system variables and
          variable implementation
        * src/g_util.c: Added scm_2_cstring function.
        * src/i_callbacks.c:  Added new call-back for configure_settings.
          Replaced explicit strings for colormaps with macros defined in
          gschem_sdefines.h and modified view_XXX_colors call backs to use
          new load_color_scheme function. Relocated calls to x_color_free()
          and x_color_allocate () to new the function in x_color.c.
        * src/x_color.c: Added new function load_color_scheme.

2007-05-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_image.c: Applied fix for "Write image" seg fault found (and
        fixed) by Robert Fitzsimons.  Thanks!

2007-05-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20070526 in prep for the next
        release.

2007-05-15 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        * src/o_complex.c: Fixed offset in o_complex_translate_all to
          be relative to bottom left of world bounds. This bug appears
          to have crept in when switching to world coords, as the
          numerical sense of "top" and "bottom" are switched around.
          These variables eventually need renaming {x|y}_{min|max} to
          avoid further confusion.

2007-05-14 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        *po/de_DE.po: updated german translation

        *src/rcstrings.c: added new menu entries

2007-05-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/nl_NL.po: Copied in new updated Dutch translation from
        Bert Timmerman.  Thanks.

        * po/it_IT.po: Copied in new updated Italian translation from
        Michele Petrecca.  Thanks.

2007-05-10 Peter Brett <peter@peter-b.co.uk>

        * include/prototype.h, src/x_menus.c: Provide
          g_file_set_contents() if GLib < 2.8.

          Patch from Ivan Stankovic, fixing problem with recent files
          support where gschem didn`t work on systems with older versions
          of GLib, due to g_file_set_contents() not being available.

2007-05-05 Peter Brett <peter@peter-b.co.uk>

        * include/prototype.h, lib/system-gschemrc.in, src/gschem.c,
          src/x_menus.c, src/x_window.c: Add "Recent Files" list to
          gschem.

          Applied patch #1706411 by Ivan Stankovic, which adds a list of
          recently-accessed files to gschem`s File menu.

2007-04-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves (AT) iespana (DOT) es>

        * src/x_image.c: Added sanity check.

        * po/es_ES.po: Updated spanish translation.

2007-04-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves (AT) iespana (DOT) es>

        * include/prototype.h, src/g_keys.c, src/g_register.c,
          i_callbacks.c: Remove "help-manual" Guile callback.

          Apply patch by Peter Brett.

          The role of the "help-manual" Guile function exported by
          gschem has been superceded by the new "gschem-browse-wiki"
          function.  This patch removes "help-manual" from the C
          source code entirely; "help-manual" is now a Scheme function
          defined in "system-gschemrc".


        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Use gschem-browse-wiki also
          when opening the manual.

          Found a workaround to use gschem-browse-wiki if the user
          wants to display the manual (the manual page is not in
          the wiki directory).

2007-04-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        (a few weeks from now).

2007-04-21 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        * src/gschem.c, src/i_callbacks.c, src/x_fileselect.c, src/x_pagesel.c,
          src/x_window.c: Cleaned up and consolidated code which creates
          new pages.  This makes the code cleaner and easier to read,
          and fixes bugs related to stray, "unknown" named pages being
          left when creating a new window.  Fixes bug #1699970, with
          changes based upon patch #1704834.

        * src/o_undo.c: Whitespace and readability fixes, removed some
          unused code.

2007-04-21  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@sentex.ca>

        * scripts/print.scm: Commented out first the four lines so that
          printing defaults don`t get accidentally overridden.

2007-04-21 Peter Brett <peter@peter-b.co.uk>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Change keystrokes for grid size change
        shortcuts.

        Incrementing/decrementing the grid size is something that users
        are likely to do several times in quick succession.  As such, it
        the keystroke should be a single key. This sets
        increment/decrement to ']' and '[' respectively.

2007-04-21 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        * src/g_keys.c, src/x_print.c: Check return value of
          gdk_keyval_name() is non NULL before attempting to match
          against it. Fixes bug #1692634.

        * configure.ac.in: Added explicit test for locale.h

        * src/i_callbacks.c: Make test for revert page question more
          succinct, testing for the absence of the "YES" response, rather
          than for the various ways the user might cancel the dialog.

        * src/o_arc.c: Fix for drawing a dotted arc / circle with
          angular dot spacing too small to render. Was a sign error
          in the alternative codepath for drawing these cases.

2007-04-21 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves (AT) iespana (DOT) es>

       * configure.ac.in, scripts/Makefile.am, scripts/config.sh.in,
         scripts/gschemdoc.sh:

         Applied patch by Peter Brett. Moved gschemdoc from
         utils/scripts to gschem/scripts.

       * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Use PgUp & PgDn to change pages in gschem.

         Applied patch from Peter Brett. Thanks!

         Not only is it more intuitive to use the page keys to swap
         between pages, but the current bindings ('<' & '>') don`t
         work on German keyboards.

       * src/x_fileselect.c:
         Make "Save" the default response in the save page dialog.
         FR #1704919. Thanks to rikster for reporting this FR.

       * src/x_dialog.c:
         Make "Save changes" the default response in the close page
         confirmation dialog.

       * src/o_picture.c, src/x_attribedit.c, src/x_autonumber.c,
         src/x_compselect.c, src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c,
         src/x_image.c, src/x_log.c, src/x_multiattrib.c,
         src/x_pagesel.c, src/x_print.c, src/x_script.c,
         src/i_callbacks.c:

         - Set the alternative button order for gtk dialogs
           (now with correct responses).

         - Reverted the changes below.
           gtk_dialog_set_alternative_button_order should have the same
           responses as the dialogs.

         - Set the alternative button order for gtk dialogs.
         This would allow to display the correct button order whatever
         system is running this app. Fix for bug #1553483.

        * src/i_callbacks.c:
          - Do nothing if the user deletes the page revert question dialog.

          - Pop up a message if there is no component selected and the user
          hits help->component documentation menu.

        * src/x_compselect.c:
          Make the component selector filter case insensitive.
          Fixes bug #1673589. Thanks to Phil Endecott for reporting the
          bug.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Apply patch from Peter Brett. Thanks!
          Rearrange gschem help menu & make it link to wiki pages.

          Rearrange the gschem help menu:
           - "Manual" now links directly to the gschem User Guide.
              (Note by cnieves: I commented this out until the gsch2pcb
              tutorial gets into the wiki and the UG wiki page is improved).
           - "FAQ" now links directly to the gschem FAQ
           - Add menu item which links directly to the wiki root page
           - Rearrange "About" and "Hotkeys" to bottom of menu

        * include/prototype.h, src/g_funcs.h, src/g_register.c:
          Apply patch from Peter Brett, adding the gschem-browse-wiki
          Scheme function. Thanks!

          This function allows Scheme code to open a browser to a wiki page
          by calling gschemdoc with its -w option.

          This will facilitate adding more useful things to gschem`s "Help"
          menu without needing a large number of callbacks to be added to
          gschem.

2007-04-21 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        * src/x_print.c: Fix color printing of selected object to use the
          correct, non-selected color for the output. This required replacing
          code which manually cleared the selection GList with a call to
          o_selection_unselect_list(), which takes care of the color change.

2007-04-17 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        Merge changes from noscreen branch

        2007-04-12 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/g_hook.h: Fixed up documentation in to reflect
                  the current code.  Removed doc reference to
                  world_get_complex_bounds(), which is not used.

        2007-04-06 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/o_select.c: Fixed selection box testing which had
                  some <= and => tests reversed during screen->world
                  coordinate switching. The swap was incorrect, as "top"
                  and "bottom" should actually be named "y_min" and
                  "y_max". The nameing is wrong in the world coordinate
                  system.

        2007-04-02 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/o_attrib.c, src/o_buffer.c: Fix for paste-buffer
                  operation, and for placing top-level attributes. Calls
                  to world_get_complex_bounds() were incorrect, and
                  needed replacing with world_get_object_list_bounds().

        2007-03-27 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/i_vars.c: Fixed copy-paste typo which over-wrote
                  mousepan_gain instead of select_slack_pixels.

        2007-03-26 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/o_text.c: Removed unused variables left in
                o_text_draw_rectangle()

                * src/o_box.c, src/o_circle.c, src/o_picture.c: Pass
                  OBJECT instead of derived type into
                  world_get_..._bounds().

                * include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h,
                  lib/system-gschemrc.in, src/g_rc.c, src/g_register.c,
                  src/i_vars.c, src/o_find.c: Added rc option
                  (select-slack-pixels #) to control how near an object
                  we have to be in order to select it by clicking. Default
                  is 4 pixels.

        2007-03-24 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/o_text.c: Modified text o_text_draw_rectangle()
                  to use the world bounds of the text, fixing the outline
                  offset when the text is aligned other than bottom, left.

                * src/o_grips.c: Removed call to o_line_recalc() after
                  o_net_modify() in o_grips_end() since the recalc is
                  done inside o_net_modify().

                * src/o_misc.c: Add call to o_complex_recalc() in
                  o_update_component() to ensure bounds are correct
                  after an embeded component is updated.

        2007-02-25 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/o_arc.c, src/o_basic.c, src/o_box.c, src/o_bus.c,
                  src/o_circle.c, src/o_complex.c, src/o_line.c, src/o_net.c,
                  src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin.c, src/o_text.c: Remove calls
                  to o_..._recalc() or equivelant from drawing routines.

                * src/a_zoom.c: Changed call to world_get_complex_bounds()
                  to world_get_object_list_bounds(), and added logic to
                  stop the zoom-extents operation if the object list
                  evaluated has no bounds (e.g. object list just has hidden
                  attributes).

                * src/o_basic.c, src/o_complex.c, src/o_find.c,
                  src/o_move.c, src/o_select.c, src/o_text.c:
                  Switched over to caching world rather than screen coordinates

                * src/g_hook.c: Removed conditional update of screen coords
                  in g_set_attrib_text_properties, since o_text_recreate()
                  should be recalculating as necessary.

2007-04-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_misc.c: Fixed memory leak in the update component code
        reported by valgrind.

2007-04-14 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/x_compselect.h, src/i_callbacks.c, src/x_compselect.c:
          Added an "ok" button to the component selector, which hides it
          while the user places the components.

        * scheme/auto-place-attribs.scm:
            - Use ceiling instead of inexact->exact.
              The latter doesn`t round if the argument is 400.5 (example).
            - Added support for net and bus attributes.
            - In adjust_pos_to_avoid_collision, don`t loop again if
            the offset is changed, and fixed x_offset instead of y_offset
            bug.
        * lib/system-gschemrc.in:
            - Added autoplacement grid.
            - Added complex list changed hook to the hooks to be enabled
              if the user wants attribute autoplacement.

            - Added default positions for device and netname attributes
          in default-position-of-text-attributes,

        * src/g_hook.c: Fixed custom_world_get_single_object_bounds,
          and custom_world_get_object_list_bounds, so they don`t traverse
          the whole object list.

        * include/globals.h, include/prototype.h, src/g_register.c,
          src/globals.c, src/o_complex.c, src/x_event.c:
          Added complex place list changed hook.
          This is the list used when placing new components.

2007-04-07 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/x_dialog.c: Redraw the schematic after changing the snap size.
          Thanks to Peter Clifton for reporting the bug. Closes bug #1657496.

2007-04-06 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in, scheme/auto-place-attribs.scm:
          Improved the auto placing: if the attribute overlaps with pins
          (including pinnumbers), or the pin connection direction where
          a net is supposed to be drawn, then the attributes are moved
          automatically.

2007-03-31 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        * src/x_dialog.c: Fixed confirm save on page-close dialogs to correctly
          cancel, rather than assert if the dialog is closed with the ESCAPE
          key, or with the window-manager`s destroy button.

2007-02-25 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        * src/o_arc.c, src/o_box.c, src/o_circle.c, src/o_line.c,
          src/x_multiattrib.c, src/x_pagesel.c, src/x_preview.c,
          src/x_window.c: Replaced loosely typed function pointers such as
          void (*draw_func)(); with more strongly typed pointers.

2007-02-24 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        Merge changes to date from noscreen branch.

        2007-02-24 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/o_box.c: Remove a copy-paste error which added an extra arguemnt
                  when calling (*fill_func). Result was drawing errors, and an infinite
                  loop when mesh filling.

        2007-02-12 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/x_dialog.c: Removed all calls to o_object_recalc()
                  now the data it calculates is no longer used.

                * src/o_arc.c, src/o_box.c, src/o_bus.c, src/o_circle.c,
                  src/o_line.c, src/o_net.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin.c,
                  src/o_select.c, src/o_text.c: Modified drawing routines
                  to calculate coordinates directly from object world coords.

                * src/o_arc.c, src/o_box.c, src/o_circle.c, src/o_line.c,
                  src/o_picture.c: Modified grip drawing / undrawing code
                  to calculate coordinates directly from object world coords.

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_grips.c: Changed to use world
                  coordinates internally for region checking.

                * src/i_pan_world.c, src/i_callbacks.c, src/o_buffer.c,
                  src/o_complex.c, src/o_copy.c, src/o_move.c,
                  src/x_attribedit.c, src/x_dialog.c, src/x_event.c:
                  Add manual grid-snapping after calls to SCREENtoWORLD()
                  where grid snapping would be required.  In preparation
                  for removing grid snap from SCREENtoWORLD().

                * src/x_event.c: Grid snap in x_event.c after converting
                  to world coords, rather than before. (The computation
                  for grid snapping in screen coords involves a conversion
                  to world coords and back)

        2006-12-27 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_move.c: Modify
                  o_move_end_lowlevel() to not require screen coordinates
                  as a parameter (which were unused). Alter usage in
                  o_move_end() as appropriate.

                * src/o_text.c: Modify o_text_place_rotate() to use world
                  coordinates, and o_text_rotate_world internally.

                * include/prototype.h, src/i_callbacks.c, src/o_complex.c,
                  src/o_misc.c, src/x_event.c: Made o_complex_rotate().
                  into o_complex_rotate_world(), made o_rotate_90() into
                  o_rotate_90_world(), and converted usage as appropriate.

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_complex.c: Remove unused
                  function o_complex_mirror2()

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_misc.c, src/o_complex.c,
                  src/i_callbacks.c, src/x_event.c: Made o_complex_mirror()
                  into o_complex_mirror_world(), made o_mirror() into
                  o_mirror_world(), and converted usage as appropriate.

2007-02-24 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * x_dialog.c: removed unused functions generic_text_input*

        * x_basic.c: removed unused dialog functions x_create_dialog_box*

2007-02-24 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * scheme/gschem.scm (dump-keymap): New procedure for
        g_keys_dump_keymap() replacing old fill-mapped-keys.

        * src/g_register.c, src/g_funcs.c (g_funcs_key_*):
        Removed functions. Replaced with g_keys_dump_keymap()

        * src/g_keys.c (g_keys_dump_keymap): New function to obtain
        current keymap from scheme.

        * src/x_event.c, src/gschem.c, src/g_keys.c:
        Removed empty function set_window_current_key()

        * src/gschem.c, src/x_dialog.c: Adaptation for new
        g_keys_dump_keymap(). (Patches written by Patrick Bernaud)

2007-02-24 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/x_window.c (x_window_search_page_clist(): Removed unused
          function (no more needed in page manager).
          (Patch written by Patrick Bernaud)

2007-02-23 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, lib/system-gschemrc.in, src/g_keys.c,
          src/g_register.c, src/i_callbacks.c:
          Added two new hotkeys to increase and decrease the snap grid size.
          Feature Request #1443637. Thanks to KaiMartin for the suggestion.

        * src/x_image.c: Free the GError after using it, and don`t unlink
          the image file in case of errors. It`s not always safe.
          For example: if the operation was not allowed due to permissions,
          the _previous existing_ file will be removed.

2007-02-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in : Changed the title of the save image
          dialog from "Write PNG..." to "Write image...", since gschem can
          now support more types than PNG.

        * include/prototype.h, src/g_funcs.c, src/i_callbacks.c,
          src/x_image.c:
          Changed the export image dialog by a new one using a GTK
          file chooser dialog with image size and image type drop-down
          lists.
          If compiled without libgd support (therefore using libgdk-pixbuf),
          gschem will support several image types (like PNG, JPEG and ICO).

2007-02-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/nl_NL.po: Updated Dutch translation from Bert Timmerman. Thanks.

        * src/i_callbacks.c: Fixed update component to work again.
        It broken during the transition from Ales custom linked list
        implementation for the selection lists to using GList for
        selection lists.  It seems that iterating over a list that is
        being change doesn`t work in the same way with GLists.        Fix for
        this was to make a shallow copy of the selection list and use
        that copy when iterating.

        * src/i_callbacks.c: Change the behavior of update component
        a little.  Update component will deselect all non OBJ_COMPLEX
        objects after it has finished running.        This will give you
        an indication as to which components were update or changed.
        The behavior before was completely silent with no feedback that
        anything happened.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Since gtk+ 2.x is supposedly correctly
        raising dialog boxes (and most of the dialog boxes within gschem
        have been converted to GtkDialog), raise-dialog-boxes-on-expose`s
        default is now disabled.  Thanks to Werner for figuring the dialog
        situation.

        the postscript-font-scale rc keyword.

2007-02-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/x_compselect.h, include/x_pagesel.h, src/o_bus.c,

        * scheme/auto-place-attribs.scm: Check if the list is empty before
          calling to stable-sort. It is an error for guile versions >= 1.8.

        * include/prototype.h, src/o_misc.c: Moved o_embed and o_unembed
        into libgeda so that gschlas can also call these functions
        (to add shell scriptable embed/unembed of all components/pictures
        functionality).

2007-01-05 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * configure.ac.in: Applied patch from Peter Clifton, adding
          missing AC_DEFINE(HAS_LIBGD, 1,...) which is still required
          to enable libgd support.

          GtkFileSelection dialog with a GtkFileChooserDialog

        * src/x_script.c: replaced the GtkFileSelection dialog with a
          GtkFileChooserDialog

        * src/x_log.c: insert text at the end of the buffer instead of cursor
          position. Replaced gtk_text_view_scroll_to_iter() with
          gtk_text_view_scroll_to_mark() which works more reliable.

2006-12-31 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/x_autonumber.c: fixed a bug if one searchtext is a subset
          of another one. Bug reported by Levente Kovacs.

2006-12-23 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/g_hook.c (g_add_component): Return if scm_comp_name is
          an empty list (guile`s NULL), or the scheme`s boolean false.
          This was suggested by Peter TB Brett and Steve Tell.

        * src/g_hook.c (g_add_component):
          Changed the end of this function to avoid the "Statement not reached"
          compiler warning. Thanks to Dan McMahill for reporting this.

2006-12-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/g_hook.c:
          -  Added some documentation to custom_world_get_complex_bounds and

        * src/o_copy.c, o_find.c, x_event.c: Update interface of
        o_selection_print_all() to match other o_selection_*() functions. Pass the
        GList by reference.

        * src/o_misc.c: Remove use of o_selection_select() and
        o_selection_unselect() (should only be used internally to libgeda).

        * src/o_attrib.c, src/o_buffer.c, src/o_complex.c, src/o_copy.c,
        src/o_misc.c, src/o_select.c, src/o_text.c: Update interface of
        o_selection_add() to match o_selection_remove(). Pass the GList by
        reference so head can be updated.

2006-12-21 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/x_dialog.c: use GtkDialog for the find text, the show text and
          the hide text dialog. Code cleanups.

        * src/x_autonumber.c: fixed o_selection_remove call which caused
          gschem to crash. suggestion by Ales, patch from Peter Brett.

        * src/x_dialog.c: cosmetics in the color dialog,
          use GtkDialog for the hotkeys dialog, use a GList to store the

2006-12-19 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/x_dialog.c: cosmetics in the translate dialog
          use GtkDialog for the arc angle, the text size and the snap size
          dialog. Use GtkSpinButtons for the three dialogs.

2006-12-18 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/x_dialog.c: some more code refactoring in the dialogs
          edit filltype, edit linetype and edit text. Use the style constants
          from x_dialog.h

        * include/x_dialog.h: added constants for dialog layout style

        * src/x_dialog.c: use GtkDialog for text entry dialog, some code
          refactoring. Fixed a bug in select_all_text_in_textview() which
          toggled the selection instead of selecting it.

        * src/o_picture.c: set transient_for flag for the dialogs
          add image and modify image.

        * src/x_attribedit.c: set transient_for flag for the dialog

        * src/x_compselect.c: set the widget focus to the filter entry

          the dialog with "i". (ideas from Peter Clifton)

2006-12-17 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * src/x_autonumber.c: Replace GTK-26 ism with 2.4 fcns.  Thanks,
        Werner, for the suggestion!

2006-12-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        Merged Carlos glist work via Peter Brett`s patch sets to the trunk

        2006-10-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

                * src/o_delete.c: Changed a check to use glib debugging
                functions.  Don`t free objects at the end of o_delete,
                but free only the list.

                * src/o_misc.c: Added a sanity check.

                * src/o_basic.c: Don`t free objects in the complex place
                list. It is only a reference to the objects in the page.

        2006-10-21 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

                * include/prototype.h, src/g_hook.c, src/i_basic.c,
                src/i_callbacks.c, src/o_attrib.c, src/o_basic.c,

                src/x_event.c, src/x_multiattrib.c, src/x_print.c:
                Convert the SELECTION list to a GList.

                * src/a_zoom.c, src/o_arc.c, src/o_basic.c, src/o_box.c,
                * src/o_basic.c: Rename o_recalc to o_recalc_object_list.

                * src/o_basic.c, src/o_complex.c, src/o_move.c,
                src/o_text.c, src/x_image.c: Rename get_complex_bounds
                to get_object_list_bounds.

2006-12-15 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
        * intl/.cvsignore: Remove whitespace after .c and .y exclusions

2006-12-14 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/g_hook.c (g_add_component): Don`t log message if a component
          name "" is passed to this function.
          Changed the function name in the error messages from
          add-component to add-component-at-xy.
          The scheme name of the function was changed on 2006-10-03, but
          not the error messages.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added comment about how to avoid gschem
          placing a titleblock automatically.

2006-12-13 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/g_hook.c: Improved error detection in g_add_attrib.
          This should fix bug #1599582.

        * scheme/auto-place-attribs.scm:
          - Define object types here (by now). This shouldn`t be here,
            and should be defined in libgeda if anyone objects.
          - in get-reference, the object bounds should include the pins
            if the object is a pin, but otherwise don`t .
            This makes the object bounds correctly calculated for pins.
            Thanks to Ales for reporting this bug.
          - Corrected typo (horiz-pos should be vertical-pos) in
            calcule-new-string-bounds.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Fixed typo in the default pin attributes.

2006-12-12 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        merged the autonumber branch back to trunk

        2006-12-12 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        sync autonumber branch with trunk

        2006-11-28 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * src/x_autonumber.c: visual improvements of the sortorder
          combobox. Patch by Tomaz Solc, slightly changed.

        2006-11-26 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * src/x_autonumber.c: remove the slot attribute if remove numbers
          and slotting is active.

        2006-11-24 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * src/x_autonumber.c: repaired keypress events, added gettext macros
          replaced the sortorder ratio buttons with a combo box. That shrinks
          the dialog a lot.

        * po/POTFILES.in: added x_autonumber.c

        * bitmap/gschem-fileorder.png: added an ugly dummy bitmap

        2006-11-11 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * src/x_autonumber.c: added used_slot database. This fixes a
          problem with duplicate slotted objects.
          Removed keyboard accelerators (by Tomaz Solz #1589430)

        2006-11-09 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * src/x_autonumber.c:  (scope_skip == SCOPE_SELECTED) didn`t work as
          expected, fixed it.

        2006-11-07 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * src/o_slot.c, x_dialog.c: removed redundant o_undo_savestate() in
          o_slot_end(). But it is required in the slot_edit_dialog_ok()
          function. This repairs to many undo states when using the
          autoslotting feature of the autonumber dialog.

        * src/x_autonumber.c:  Added improved autonumber dialog from
          Tomaz Solz (#1589430)

        2006-11-06 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/o_misc.c, src/x_dialog.c, src/x_autonumber.c: moved all
          autonumber related code to x_autonumber.c
          applied patch (#1589430) from Tomaz Solz

        * bitmap/: added bitmaps for the autonumber dialog

2006-12-10 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/x_dialog.c: use GtkDialog for color edit dialog, the
          slot attribute dialog, the linetype dialog, the linestyle
          dialog and the translate dialog.
          set default response, cosmetics changes and fixes.

2006-12-09 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/x_compselect.c: added transient_for flag to the dialog

        * src/x_fileselect.c: set default response to OK

        * src/x_print.c: set default response to print, added transient_for
          flag, fixed a keyval "Return" instead of "linefeed"

        * src/x_image.c: use GtkDialog for the PNG export dialog.
          added a filechooser dialog, misc cosmetics.

        * src/x_dialog.c: use GtkDialog for text property dialog.
          code cleanup and cosmetics

2006-12-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * autogen.sh, Makefile.am, configure.ac, configure.ac.in: Changed
        the configure.ac and autogen.sh files to dynamically figure out the
        gettext version (instead of hard coding the version) when autogen.sh
        is ran.  Hard coding 0.15 inside configure.ac broke everybody
        who doesn`t have gettext 0.15 installed.  The configure.ac file
        is now generated from the configure.ac.in.  configure.ac was
        removed from CVS at this point.

        * .cvsignore: Added configure.ac into this file so that it is ignored
         when doing cvs update.

2006-12-05 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * lib/system_gschemrc.in, scheme/auto-place-attribs.scm:
          Make the auto place function smarter when dealing with objects
          with pins on 3 or 4 sides. Now it avoids to overlap the pins or
          the attributes when autoplacing.

        * include/prototype.h, src/g_hook.c, src/g_register.c:
          Changed scheme function g_get_object_bounds to accept two
          more parameters, allowing to exclude attributes, or objects types
          when calculing the object bounds.

        * src/x_compselect.c: clib_directories is now a double linked list.

2006-12-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added Control-x, Control-c, Control-v
        for cut buffer, copy buffer, and paste buffer menu and hotkey
        items.        The paste automatically shows the outline (just like
        pressing "yp").  Changed the behavior of all the paste menu
        options to automatically show an outline of the paste buffer
        (just like pressing "yp").  This should make it more obvious as
        to what to do when pasting.

        * src/i_basic.c, src/i_callbacks.c: Modified the code to
        enable/disable the new Cut, Copy, and Paste commands.  Also
        modified the code to properly enable and disable the "Buffer/Paste
        from X" commands only if there is something in the buffer.

        * src/i_basic.c: Also added the code to enable/disable "Multiple
        Copy Mode".  Also fixed a unused variable compiler warning.

        * src/x_dialog.c: Increased the size of the hotkey char buffer
        for the hotkey dialog.

        * src/x_menus.c: Removed the right justification of the help menu
        item since it has gone out of style to have the help menu all the
        way on the right hand side.  Something about usability. :)

2006-12-02  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

        * include/i_vars.h include/prototype.h src/g_rc.c src/g_register.c
          src/i_vars.c: Support for rc command to set the postscript line
          default width.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added call to the new rc function
          to set the system wide default line width

        * examples/drawing_primitives.sch: Added extra line to show line
          width relative to pin and net width.

2006-12-02 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        The running of gettextize changed: ChangeLog, Makefile.am,
        configure.ac, m4/ChangeLog, m4/Makefile.am, po/Makevars.

2006-12-02  gettextize  <bug-gnu-gettext@gnu.org>

        * Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove intl.
        (EXTRA_DIST): Add config.rpath.
        * configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add po/Makefile.in.
        (AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION): Bump to 0.15.

2006-11-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Fixed libgeda detection/find error message when
        the wrong libgeda version is found. (Bug reported by Karel Kulhavy;
        thanks)

2006-11-19 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/i_basic.c, src/x_grid.c, src/x_window.c: moved the
          filename from the status bar to the window title.
          Show grid settings in the status bar.


2006-11-13 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/x_compselect.c: Always update the complex place list.
          Before, the list wasn`t updated if the user opens the file chooser
          and choose the same component and library than the last time.


2006-11-07 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/o_text.c, src/o_slot.c: fixed slot update errors
         (Bug #1589247)

2006-10-23 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/o_text.c: Changed polarity of one of the sanity checks
        in the o_text_draw function added on 2006-10-21.

2006-10-21 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/o_basic.c: Removed comment referencing to o_recalc_glist,
          which is not (yet) in CVS.

        * src/o_text.c: Added sanity checks in o_text_draw_lowlevel and
        o_text_draw functions using GLib functions.

        * src/o_text.c: Removed sanity checks in o_text_draw_lowlevel and
        o_text_draw functions added today.

        * src/a_zoom.c, src/o_arc.c, src/o_basic.c, src/o_box.c,
          src/o_buffer.c, /src/o_bus.c, src/o_circle.c, src/o_complex.c,
          src/o_cue.c, src/o_grips.c, /src/o_line.c, src/o_net.c,
          src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin.c, src/o_select.c, src/o_text.c:
          Added a new parameter to o_redraw and o_cue_redraw_all,
          to choose wether to draw the selected objects or not.
          Make o_redraw call o_redraw_all_fast, since they shared code.

        * src/o_arc.c, src/o_box.c, src/o_bus.c, src/o_circle.c,
          src/o_cue.c, src/o_grips.c, src/o_line.c, src/o_net.c,
          src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin.c, src/o_text.c:
          Don`t draw objects if w_current->DONT_REDRAW is 1.

        * src/o_text.c: Added some sanity checks in o_text_draw_lowlevel and
        o_text_draw functions.

2006-10-21 Werner Hoch  <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * po/de_DE.po: Updated German translation

2006-10-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_dialog.c, src/x_print.c, src/x_attribedit.c:  Applied patch
        by Patrick Bernaud to Change button order of dialogs to be more
        standard on *nix desktops.

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20061020.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Rearranged the order of the attribute-name
        entries and added some missing attributes.

        * po/ *.po, geda-gschem.pot: make distcheck updated all po/port files.

2006-10-20  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * po/fr_FR.po: Updated the French translation.

        * po/ *: Updated and merged i18n files for new POTFILES.

        * po/POTFILES.in: Added x_compselect.c to list.

        * src/i_callbacks.c (i_callback_close_wm): Modified prototype to
        match the one expected by GTK and made it stop further propagation
        of the signal to avoid closing the window when user cancels the
        close order. Bug reported by Werner Hoch.

2006-10-20 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * po/es_ES.po: Fixed the header of the spanish translation.
        Thanks to Werner Hoch for pointing it out.

2006-10-19 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * po/es_ES.po: Updated spanish translation.

2006-10-19  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * src/x_multiattrib.c: Fixed toggle renderers to update their
        appearance when they are activated from keyboard. Bug reported by
        Peter Clifton.

        * configure.ac: Cleaned up to remove remaining traces of noweb
        days.

        * noweb/.cvsignore: Removed file for directory to get pruned on
        checkout.

        * docs/gschemdoc.texi, docs/texinfo.tex: Removed unused files for
        old noweb documentation.

        * scripts/geda_totexi.in:
        * scripts/notangle_guile.in: Removed unused scripts for noweb.

        * po/fr_FR.po: Updated the French translation.

        * po/ *: Updated and merged i18n files.

        * src/rcstrings.c: Rebuilt file from system-gschemrc for changes
        in the application menus.

2006-10-18 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * ChangeLog: Improved description of the "fit page when window is
        maximized" patch on 2006-10-04, and added src/x_window.c: it was
        changed, but it was missing in the ChangeLog.
        Also added a note in the entry for 2006-09-30 regarding this feature,
        which relates to the entry in 2006-10-04.

        * include/prototype.h: Removed the definition of x_event_window_state.
        This function was added on 2006-09-30 when doing a zoom extents when
        the user maximizes the gschem window. It was later removed on
        2006-10-04 when Patrick found a new way to do it in x_event_configure.

        * src/i_callbacks.c: call the new page hook in the file_new_window
        callback, after the x_window_setup call (the latter creates a new
        page). Thanks to Peter Clifton for reporting the bug.

        * src/gschem.c: When modifying this file on 2006-10-16, the
        new page hook call was moved inside the parse arguments loop.
        Therefore, the hook was not called if gschem was executed without
        arguments.
        Call the hook after the loop again, but only if first_page is 1
        (i.e: if no page was loaded before).

2006-10-17  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * src/x_multiattrib.c (cellrenderermultilinetext_start_editing):
        Fixed renderer to vertically fill the area when editing data (it
        was only displaying a line with GTK > 2.8). Bug reported by Peter
        Clifton.

2006-10-16 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/gschem.c: Call the new page hook for each schematic
        specified in the command line, instead of calling it for
        only the latest.
        This way all pages are zoomed extents when loaded.
        Thanks to Peter Clifton for reporting the bug.

2006-10-13  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * src/x_compselect.c: Modified to close when Escape is pressed.
        (x_compselect_callback_response): Fixed wrong cast for dialog.
        (COMPSELECT_FILTER_INTERVAL): Added new constant for the timeout
        interval of the filter as suggested by Peter Clifton.
        Fixed and improved code documentation as suggested by Peter
        Clifton.

2006-10-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_window.c: Commited patch by Patrick to greatly reduce the
        flickering/unnecessary redrawing when opening up schematic pages.
        Thanks.

2006-10-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * src/x_compselect.c, include/x_compselect.h: Added a button to
        clear the filter entry of the component selection dialog.
        Modified to auto-update the component selection as user types in
        filter entry.

        * include/prototype.h, src/x_dialog.c: Deleted old exit_dialog.
        Added new dialog for user confirmation before closing a page or a
        window.

        * src/i_callbacks.c, src/x_fileselect.c: Adapted code to use new
        functions of x_window.c.

        * src/x_window.c: Added new functions to open, close, save and
        change page.

        * src/x_event.c (x_event_configure), src/x_window.c: Cleaned up.
        Fixed Bug#1527465: fit page zooms when window is maximized.

        Comment by cnieves on 2006-10-18: This change removes the code added
        on 2006-09-30, which tried to solve the same problem. Patrick found
        a cleaner way to do it in x_event_configure, so x_event_window_state
        is no longer needed.
        The x_window_state function is removed here, and its definition in
        include/prototype.h was deleted on 2006-10-18. Thus, all code added
        on 2006-09-30 regarding this feature is removed.

2006-10-03 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in, src/g_register.c:
        Changed the name of the new scheme function which adds a component
        at a given location to add-component-at-xy. The former name
        was already used.

2006-09-30 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Changed the definition of the default
        titleblock. Users can now easily override the default setting.

        * src/x_event.c, src/x_window.c, include/prototype.h:
        Fix for bug #1527465. Do a zoom extents for all pages when the
        main window is maximized.

        Comment by cnieves on 2006-10-18: This code was removed on 2006-10-04
        when Patrick found a cleaner way to do this without
        x_event_window_state. Read the ChangeLog entry for the given date.

        * src/x_image.c: Added the border in the gdk-pixbuf`s image output.
        Fix bug #1565433.

2006-09-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/g_hook.c: Added code to g_add_component so that the
        component is added to the object list properly.

        * src/g_hook.c: Commented out o_redraw_single call to minimize
        flickering.  At some point a g_redraw_all should be added for
        those users who want to use g_component_add from a script.

        * i_callbacks.c: Removed unnecessary redraw and scrollbar calls
        when adding a new page to minimize flicker

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Commented in Carlos` new file-new hook
        and change some of the defaults a little.  No matter what default
        I pick will probably be wrong for somebody (sorry).

        * src/x_print.c: Applied patch by Peter Brett (Patch#1567622):
        Make print settings sticky for session.  Thanks!

2006-09-30 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, lib/system-gschemrc.in, src/g_hook.c,
          src/g_register.c, src/gschem.c, src/x_window.c:
          Added a new scheme function to get the objects in a page.
          Improved the new-page-hook in system-gschemrc so it only adds
          the titleblock if the page has no objects.

2006-09-28 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/globals.h, include/prototype.h, lib/system-gschemrc.in,
          src/g_hook.c, src/g_register.c, src/globals.c, src/gschem.c,
          src/i_callbacks.c, src/x_window.c:
          Added a new page hook, a new add-component function for scheme,
          and some lines in the system-gschemrc file (commented by default),
          so gschem can add automatically a symbol when creating a new page.
          Commenting out these lines can solven bug #1443806 (gschem
          zoomed out way to much on startup).

2006-09-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * AUTHORS: Greatly simplified the file since the ChangeLog tracks
        who has changed what.  Also added a few missing names that should
        most certainly be in the list.  Also consolidated all AUTHOR files
        for gEDA/gaf into this file.

2006-09-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Tweaked glib detection to not fail ./configure
        when gdlib is not installed.  gdlib is an optional dependancy.

2006-09-24 03:57  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * configure.ac: Improve gdlib detection.  Now instead of just
          dropping gd support if gdlib is not found, have configure error
          out with a message that tells the user what needs to be fixed or
          what feature will be missing if --disable-gd is used.

          Also add a variable to libgeda.pc.in so pkg-config can determine
          if libgeda was compiled with gdlib support.  This makes
          determination of this by gschem more robust.

2006-09-23  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * src/x_fileselect.c (x_fileselect_save): Modified to set filename
        when saving a page.

        * src/x_compselect.c: Changed dialog layout for a single
        component selection tree with filtering capability.

        * src/i_callbacks.c:
        * src/x_window.c: Adapted for new file selection dialog.

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Removed code for custom file selection
        dialog: now uses only the GTK widget for file
        selection and the new preview widget. Cleaned-up code.

        * src/x_compselect.c, src/x_fileselect.c: Adapted for new preview.

        * include/x_preview.h: New file for new preview widget.

        * src/x_preview.c: Rewritten preview to make it a widget
        extending a GtkDrawingArea.

        * src/x_compselect.c: New source file for component selection
        dialog.

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Moved code of the component selection
        dialog to x_compselect.nw.

2006-09-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * README, configure.ac, src/i_callbacks.c, src/x_image.c:
          Use gd 2.0.x library instead of libgdgeda.
          libgdgeda is not used anymore. Work based on a patch by
          Wojciech Kazubski (patch #1479983).

2006-09-15 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * po/ru.po: Updated russian translation provided by Andy Shevchenko,
          (bug #1559106 submitted by Chitlesh). Thanks.

2006-09-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/prototype.h, scheme/gschem.scm, src/g_keys.c, src/x_event.c,
        src/x_window.c: Applied another patch for Bug#1553544: "New pages
        inadvertantly created when adding nets in gschem" from Peter Clifton
        to address the focus problem with the first patch.  This one is
        much better and cleaner.

2006-09-07 SDB  <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * src/xprint.c: Added "static void" declaration to
        print_dialog_get_property to prevent compiler error
        under older version of gcc.

2006-09-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated program version to 20060906.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Applied patch for Bug#1552338:
        system-gschemrc gedadata/rc mismatch (filed by Charles Lepple).
        Also fixed a few other instances where the directory for the
        scheme files were wrong.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Changed the mouse gain to be unity since
        various people have mentioned that mouse pan doesn`t feel right with
        a large value.

        * src/x_window.c: Had to put the keypress signal handler back on
        the main_window (instead of just the drawing_window), because the
        up cursor key stopped working.  The original reason for this movement
        was to fix Bug#1552778 and Bug#1553544 which are still fixed (even
        with this move it seems), however the focus on the toolbar seems
        to move when you move the cursor keys (which is a little odd).

        * po/it_IT.po: Updated to the last version provided by Michele
        Petrecca. Thanks.

        * src/gschem.c, src/g_rc.c, src/x_dialog.c: Added CUSTOM_VERSION
        to all printfs/output/dialog boxes where VERSION is used so that
        it is easier to create custom version of gEDA/gaf.

        * include/Makefile.am: Oops, x_print.h wasn`t added.  This was
        discovered by make distcheck (have I mentioned how much I like
        make distcheck. :-)

        * po/ *.po: make dist(check) updated all po files in prep for the
        new release (20060906).

2006-09-05 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Applied patch by Peter Clifton: Removed the
        "discard changes" button from the file selection dialog.

        * src/x_window.c: Applied patch by Peter Clifton: Removed key
        press event from the main window and moved it to the drawing
        area and set the mouse focus on the drawing area initially.

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Applied patch by Peter Clifton: Fixed the
        odd behavior that if the user pressed the ESCAPE key in the saveas
        dialog box, subsequent attempts to open the dialog box will fail
        with a critical gtk+ error message:
                (gschem:4708): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_window_raise: assertion
                 `GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)` failed


2006-09-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/i_vars.c: Removed code that sets up the autosave callback.
        The callback was being registered for the preview toplevel as well
        and that caused all sorts of problems.

        * src/x_window.c: Added a call to s_page_autosave_init() right after
        i_vars_set.  This is the only place we want the autosave callback
        to be registered.

2006-08-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated gtk+ tests to look for 2.4.x or greater.

2006-08-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Fixed some typos in comments.

        * gschem/include/x_print.h, gschem/include/i_vars.h,
         gschem/include/prototype.h, gschem/scripts/print.scm,
         gschem/src/g_funcs.c, gschem/src/g_rc.c, gschem/src/g_register.c,
         gschem/src/x_dialog.c, gschem/src/x_print.c, gschem/src/x_window.c:
        Applied second part of patch by Peter Brett to add a new print
        dialog to gschem.  Patch#1530417.  Unfortunately x_print.c was a
        completely by hand patch, so hopefully I got it right.  Reversed
        the "Print" and "Cancel" buttons to follow application conventions.
        Reversed "Save As" and "Cancel" buttons to follow application
        conventions.

2006-08-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * INSTALL: Updated install file a little (still somewhat dated)

        * src/o_misc.c: Fixed o_update_component to actually work correctly.
        All this time, it was just doing the wrong thing by search for
        existing components in the wrong place.  Update Component still
        doesn`t do the right thing for symversion, but that can be fixed
        later.

        * examples/filter_1.sch: Updated all components to the latest version.

        * examples/drawing_primitives.sch: Translated schematic a little so
        it looks better on the screen.

2006-08-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/Makefile.am: Removed old VPATH, since it is no longer needed
        and it is interfering with make distcheck

2006-08-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * README: Updated the README a little to be ready for the next
        release.

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Initialize preview_control to make valgrind
        happy.  Pointed out by Peter Clifton.

2006-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version number to 20060821 in prep for the
        next gEDA/gaf release.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Commented out the "Autoplace component
        text attributes hooks" since they were causing some interesting
        rendering/ghosting artifacts.  These need to be fixed before
        these hooks can be commented in by default.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Changed the middle mouse button default
        to be mousepan instead of action, since the first button now supports
        that functionality by default.

2006-08-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Applied trival patch by Peter Brett to remove
        unused variable compiler warning.

2006-08-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_copy.c: Fixed the copying of nets, pins, and buses.
        Copy for these objects has been broken for a while now in CVS only.
        This should be revisited later to fix the breakage this fix caused to
        the transparent rotation when copying objects.

        * src/x_preview.c: Applied Patch#1527418: Make preview-widget
        resizable and respond to scroll events by Peter Clifton.

        * src/x_event.c: Applied Patch#1527383: Zoom using mouse
        scroll-wheel by Peter Clifton.  Behavior of the mouse wheel with
        modifiers:
                       NONE = zoom in / out
                Shift = up / down
                Control = left / right (as existing)

        * src/o_attrib.c: Applied Patch#1531802: Bugfix for segfault
        when adding a global attribute by Tomaz Solc.

        * src/x_window.c: Applied Patch#1533822: gschem: Tidy up
        gtk_widget_show calls by Peter Brett.

        are not available.   Minor cleanup of the code afterwords.
         Removed obsolete code and functions.

        * src/ *.c: Applied patch by Tomaz Solc to add cursor key panning.
        Minor cleanup of the code afterwards (mainly to add the
        keyboardpan_gain to the toplevel as a proper rc variable)

        * po/it_IT.po: Replaced Italian translation with updates from
        Michele Petrecca.

        * po/pt_BR.po: Replaced Portugese translation with updates from
        Antonio Augusto Todo Bom Neto.

        * src/x_window.c: Converted pro-active pointer check to a g_assert
        (a good suggestion by Peter Clifton).

        * src/x_menu.c: Applied patch by Gabriel Paubert to fix building
        with --disable-nls.  Thanks!

2006-07-26 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        adding an attribute while some other attributes were selected.
        Thanks to Levente Kovacs for reporting the bug and testing the patch.

2006-07-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_window.c: Added pointer check to be pro-active.  Related to
        (Bugs#1528080)

2006-07-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_color.c: Added a missing extern keyword on colors structure

        * include/defines.h: Applied mouse pan patch by Peter Clifton.
        (Patch #1527361): Allow middle button panning in gschem
        Thanks for the patch Peter!

        * include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h, lib/system-gschemrc.in,
        src/g_rc.c, src/g_register.c, src/i_vars.c, src/x_event.c:
        Applied mouse gain patch by Peter Clifton.  Added (mousepan-gain #)
        rc option to control this gain (default is still 5).
        (Patch #1527363): Set mousepan "gain" to unity
        Thanks for the patch Peter!

2006-07-23  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

        * examples/drawing_primitives.sch: Removed extra line from text in
        drawing primitives.

2006-07-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/POTFILES.in: Updated files to get rid of old noweb references.

        * po/ *.po, po/gschem.pot: Updated files to take into account above
        changes (via make dist).

        * src/rcstrings.c, src/Makefile.am, po/POTFILES.in: Oops forgot
        about this file (thanks Werner); added file back and updated po
        files via make dist again.

2006-07-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        src/x_menus.c, src/x_pagesel.c, src/x_print.c, src/x_stroke.c,
        src/x_window.c: Converted all free, ?alloc, and strdup calls to
        use g_free, g_?alloc, and g_strdup.  This is the first phase in
        fixing the slice crash under glib 2.10.x.  Also fixed some -pedantic
        compiler warnings.

        * src/o_picture.c, src/x_image.c: Changed all g_free() calls
        on all pixbuf objects to be g_object_unref.  This was causing
        crashes with glib 2.10.x.

        * src/x_image.c: Oops, g_object_unref, not g_object_ref

2006-07-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * Applied and commited Jason Childs` noweb removal patch and added
        the new C source files.

          Ported as real c source code file in the src directory.
          Deleted after porting all noweb comments into doxygen format
          in respective c source files.

        * noweb: Removed subdirectory.

        * src/Makefile.am: Updated to build from c source instead of noweb.
          Fixed distclean setup to not remove c source files.

        * docs/Makefile.am: Added support for Doxygen html and LaTex
          documents.  Fixed distclean setup to not remove required Doxygen html
          files, and to remove html and latex subdirectories on clean.

        * Makefile.am: Removed noweb as a buildable subdirectory.

        * configure.ac: Removed checks for noweb and texi2html.
          Added check for Doxygen.

2006-06-02  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Corrected comments about PS backend, and
          changed default to not render vector text for multiline text
          items.  Added documentation that shows valid values.

        * noweb/g_rc.nw: Removed check for negative numbers in
          g_rc_output_vector_threshold() as any value is valid now.
          Negative numbers indicate that vector text is not desired when
          printing multiline text.

2006-05-21 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de:

        * src/Makefile.am: moved the comment sign to the first column.
          "make reconfig" is happy now.

2006-05-20 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, noweb/o_find.nw, noweb/x_event.nw:
        Fixed issue with the selection box when some components overlap.
        This bug was introduced when adding support for object movement
        like "click and drag" style.

        * noweb/g_hook.nw: Fixed bug when calculating the object bounds
        in text autoplacing.

        * src/Makefile.am: Commented out the indentation of the C code,
        so gdb can return correct information when debugging.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw, noweb/x_event.nw: Moved rotated_inside into
        the TOPLEVEL structure.

2006-05-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * scripts/notangle_guile.in: Applied patch by Steve Brown to fix
        guile stack overflow

        * src/Makefile.am: Changed the .nw.c: rule to redirect the generated
        C file to a temp file and then move it to the real one.         This fixes
        the stale file problem when notangle fails.

        * noweb/o_find.nw: #if1ed out some print statements

2006-05-17  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

        * examples/drawing_primitives.sch
          Added example file with a sample of each drawing primitive
        * examples/Makefile.am
          Added target to distribute drawing primitive schematic

2006-05-17 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h, lib/system-gschemrc.in,
          noweb/i_vars.nw, noweb/o_find.nw:
          Added support for moving the selected objects just dragging them.

          Don`t draw text if w_current->DONT_REDRAW == 1.

2006-05-16 22:31  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * include/Makefile.am, include/prototype.h, noweb/g_funcs.nw,
          noweb/g_register.nw, noweb/x_dialog.nw, scheme/pcb.scm: Add a
          (gschem-filesel) guile function which gives a generic file open
          and save as dialog box.  Add some placeholder code to the pcb
          major mode showing how this routine is used.        While here update
          the pcb major mode TODO list a bit.

2006-05-16 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>:

        * noweb/o_pin.nw: o_pin_end(): fixed whichend drawing and
          connection checks.

2006-05-14 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * noweb/x_event.nw: x_event_expose(): fixed some of the redraw error
          when changing the windows while drawing

        * noweb/o_basic.nw: moved DRAWCOMP state in o_redraw_cleanstates()

        * noweb/o_net.nw: o_net_xorrubber(): added code for L-net

2006-04-25 22:26  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * include/prototype.h, noweb/g_funcs.nw, noweb/g_register.nw,
          noweb/x_dialog.nw, scheme/pcb.scm: - add gschem-log, gschem-msg,
          gschem-confirm scheme functions for logging to the log,
          displaying a message in a dialog box and executing a confirm
          dialog box from scheme.

          - make the pcb mode take advantage of these new features.

2006-04-25 02:14  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * scheme/pcb.scm: - clean up the code which checks to see if the
          pipe to pcb is open.        - add signal handlers and exception
          handlers to gracefully deal with   the user exiting from PCB.  No
          more crashes from that! - shorten the TODO list :)

2006-04-24 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * noweb/a_zoom.nw: removed redundant redraw

        * noweb/a_basic.nw, noweb/i_callback.nw: added support for transparent
          zoom while moving, copying and component placement and modifiing.
          (changes in o_redraw_all(), modifiing arc`s and zoom does not work)
          Added a intermediary select state to enable state jumps.
          (o_redraw_cleanstates() and it`s calls)

2006-04-24 04:02  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: move the (still commented out) stuff
          about pcb to the bottom of the file so the PCB menu ends up on
          the right instead of the left.  Also we only need to load the
          pcb.scm file, not manually install the hooks.

2006-04-24 03:59  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * scheme/pcb.scm: - add the add-hook calls to this file.  We only
          want the user to have   to load this file to get everything
          going.

          - add some real stuff to the custom menu.  We can actually launch
          pcb        now!

          - update the TODO list

2006-04-24 03:28  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/o_select.nw: repair broken select box

2006-04-24 03:06  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/: o_basic.nw, o_buffer.nw, o_copy.nw, o_find.nw,
          o_select.nw, o_text.nw, x_image.nw, x_print.nw: Repair a segfault
          introduced by my last commit.  This makes sure we always pass in
          the correct types to o_select_run_hooks().  For the deselect all,
          we just pass in a NULL value for o_current and make sure we
          detect that.

2006-04-23 03:48  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * include/globals.h, include/prototype.h, lib/system-gschemrc.in,
          noweb/g_register.nw, noweb/globals.nw, noweb/o_basic.nw,
          noweb/o_buffer.nw, noweb/o_copy.nw, noweb/o_find.nw,

          noweb/x_print.nw, scheme/Makefile.am, scheme/pcb.scm: add support
          for some new hooks:

          select_component_hook select_net_hook deselect_component_hook
          deselect_net_hook deselect_all

          In addition provide a partial example of how one can use these
          hooks to communicate to pcb.

2006-04-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * noweb/o_complex.nw, noweb/o_move.nw: Allow placing and moving
          complex objects inside complex objects.

2006-04-15 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * noweb/o_arc.nw: corrected ARC_END_ANGLE calculation in
          o_arc_rubberband(), simplified the function.
          this fixes bug 1468682

        * noweb/i_pan_world.nw: set loc_x/y to 0 in i_pan_world_general,
          this fixes a zoom-while-drawing error

2006-04-14 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * noweb/a_zoom.nw, noweb/i_pan_world.nw: rubberband redrawing changed
          moved coordinate calculations to i_pan_world_general()

        * noweb/i_callback.nw: removed limitations of paning while drawing
        * noweb/o_basic.nw: small fix for moving while drawing

        * noweb/x_print.nw: GTK_BOX pointer type fixes

        * noweb/x_event.nw: drop redundant x_event_motion() events if no
          mouse button or modifier key change occured.
          This speeds up moving large selections, copying selections and
          mouse paning.

2006-04-09 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * scheme/auto-place-attribs.scm: Applied patch from Steve Brown
          It fixes the get_reference function to always return an integer
          value for horiz-pos and vertical-pos. This fixes bug 1463066.
          Thanks for the patch.

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw: Add the "discard changes" button to the
          close page dialog. This fixes bug 1442948.

2006-04-09 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: find_text_dialog(): moved the descend
          checkbutton from the action_area to the vbox.

        * noweb/i_pan_world.nw: i_pan_world(), i_pan_world_mouse() rewritten, they'll use
          i_pan_world_general() now, i_pan_world_calc() removed.

        * noweb/i_pan_world, noweb/a_zoom.nw, noweb/i_callbacks.nw, noweb/o_misc.nw,
          noweb/x_event.nw: bugfix for "[ 1443804 ] gschem scrollbars not
          updating in all cases", added missing scrollbar updates, removed
          duplicate o_redraw_all_fast() calls.

2006-04-03 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * noweb/x_print.nw: print dialog: widged packing fixed,
          reported by Tomasz Nowak

2006-03-12 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Removed load for the system-gafrc file,
        since it is loaded by libgeda first.

2006-02-26 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * noweb/g_hook.nw: Erase the text before changing its attributes
          in g_set_attrib_text_properties.

2006-02-25 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/globals.h, include/prototype.h, noweb/g_hook.nw,
          noweb/g_register.nw, noweb/globals.nw, noweb/o_pin.nw,
          noweb/o_misc.nw, noweb/o_attrib.nw, noweb/o_complex.nw:
          Added new hooks.
          Added new scheme subroutines:
            - g_add_attrib, which adds an attribute to an object from scheme.
            - g_get_pin_ends, which returns the ends` coords of a pin.
            - g_set_attrib_text_properties, which sets all text properties
              of an attribute.
            - g_get_object_bounds, which returns a list with the object bounds.
            - g_get_object_pins, which returns a list with the pins.

        * scheme/Makefile.am, scheme/auto-place-attribs.scm:
          Added new functions to autoplace the attributes.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in:
          Modified the system-gschemrc file so gschem adds automatically
          the default pin attributes when placing a new pin, and also
          to automatically place the text attributes.

        * noweb/i_vars.h: Fixed compiler warning.

        * po/es_ES.po: fixed some strings.

2006-02-25 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/o_misc.nw: Set the backup file readonly, so an 'rm *'
        command will ask the user if he really wants to delete the file.

2006-01-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/ *: auto* tools update all po files for distribution.

        * src/Makefile.am (and the toplevel Makefile): Applied build
        patch by Matthias Wenzel.  Thanks.

        * autogen.sh, m4/guile.m4, m4/gettext.m4, src/Makefile.am: Removed
        m4 files since they are installation specifc.  Also, all required
        libraries should be coming from LIBGEDA_LDFLAGS

        * po/it_IT.po: Updated to the latest version from Michele Petrecca.
        Thanks.

2006-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw: Changed button order to be Open/Cancel and
        Save/Cancel.  This is so that the application`s dialog boxes are
        consistent everywhere.

        * README: Updated for the new year and release.

2006-01-13 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw, noweb/o_misc.nw, noweb/o_picture.nw:
        * noweb/o_text.nw, noweb/x_image.nw, noweb/x_preview.nw:
        Added missing marks for gettext on log messages.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw, noweb/x_menus.nw:
        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw, noweb/x_pagesel.nw: Marked strings in
        structures (popup menus and option menus) for i18n with N_().

        * include/globals.h: Introduced macro N_() as short for
        gettext_noop().

2006-01-07  Stuart Brorson  <sdb AT cloud9 DOT net>
        * autogen.sh, Included "-I m4" into
        aclocal to pick up macros from local m4 dir.

        *  src/Makefile.am:  Added @GUILE_LDFLAGS@ to gschem_LDADD
        to force pick-up of lguile.

2006-01-07  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * po/fr_FR.po: Updated the French translation.

        * noweb/rcstrings.nw: Updated menu entries for un/embedding
        components and pictures.

2005-12-17 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/o_attrib.nw, noweb/o_text.nw, noweb/x_multiattrib.nw:
        In x_multiattrib: moved handling of slot attribute after
        calling o_text_change or o_attrib_add_attrib into those functions.
        This is just calling o_slot_end after changed or added a slot
        attribute.
        This fixes the bug reported by Karel Kulhavy: graphic symbol is
        not updated when adding a slot attribute using the single attribute
        editor. Thanks for the bug report.

2005-12-17 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/x_attribedit.nw:
        When mass replacing properties using the add property command,
        don`t delete the old attribute and add a new one: just change
        the property text, visibility and show proerties, keeping the
        text location.
        Bug reported by Karel Kulhavy. Thanks for the bug report.

2005-12-17 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/prototype.h, noweb/x_color.nw, noweb/x_dialog.nw:
        Changed        function x_color_get_name to use dynamic memory allocation.
        Now it returns a newly allocated string with the colorname.
        This should fix a bug found by John Doty: the 'ex' command provoked
        a bus error in gschem under MacOS 10.4.3. Thanks for the bug report.

2005-12-02 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/x_preview.nw: Disable the autosave feature in previews.
        This change, together with some libgeda changes at the same date
        will fix some gschem crashes reported by David Carr. Thanks David!

2005-11-28 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw:
        Applied minor patch to file selector so the user sees the "Save as"
        button instead of "Open" when saving the schematic.
        Thanks to David Carr for noticing it and sending the patch.

2005-11-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/prototype.h, noweb/globals.h, noweb/o_misc.nw,
          noweb/x_fileselect.nw:
        Now gschems checks if there is an autosave backup file when
        loading a schematic. If it exists, then gschem asks the user
        what to do.

2005-11-18 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/prototype.h, lib/system-gschemrc.in, noweb/o_misc.nw,
          noweb/o_undo.nw:
        Changed autosave code so the timer callback doesn`t do the
        autosave backups. Now are made within o_undo_savestate, so
        backups will ONLY be saved when there was a change to the
        schematic and there was a timeout of the autosave timer.

2005-11-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_pin.nw, o_bus.nw, o_net.nw: Changed the rubber band erase
        method to properly erase all xor segments properly.

        * noweb/o_net.nw: Changed the net "L" drawing to prevent the
        drawing of the secondary net if a connection is made after the
        primary net is drawn/added.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw: Added missing if test to allow pictures to
        be unembedded.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Enabled preview by default when placing
        components.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in, noweb/i_basic.nw: Updated Embed/Unembed
        menu option to also include pictures

2005-10-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_log.nw: Added an if to prevent a core dump if the log file
        cannot be opened. Bug reported by John Luciani.

        * configure.ac: Removed check for gtk+ 2.6.x or greater since gtk+
        already provides this information.

2005-10-29 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h, lib/system-gschemrc.in,
          noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/g_register.nw, noweb/i_vars.nw,
          noweb/o_undo.nw:
          Added support for backup copies and autosaving every
          "interval" seconds (configurable through system-gschemrc).

2005-10-23 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/prototype.h, noweb/x_fileselect.nw, noweb/x_preview.nw:
        Removed a conditional #if in x_preview_setup. It was introduced in
        my last changes.
        x_preview_setup should create the drawing_area. Otherwise, it
        will segfault when adding a new component.
        Added check at the beginning of x_fileselect_setup to use the
        old function when adding a new component, before doing anything
        else.

2005-10-17 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/prototype.h, noweb/x_fileselect.nw, noweb/x_preview.nw:
        Updated file load/save window using GTK widgets. File preview is
        missing yet.

2005-10-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_image.nw: Added some code to make sure non-default sized
        image are correctly created.  Added code to convert pixbufs to
        greyscale to implement the image-color rc keyword.

        * configure.ac: Added check for gtk+ 2.6.x or greater to support some
        future additions.

2005-10-15 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/x_image.nw: Remove the grid when exporting to PNG.
        Reorganize and comment some code.
        Remove text origin markers when exporting to PNG.

2005-10-15 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/prototype.h, noweb/i_callbacks.nw, noweb/x_image.nw:
        Added code to export the schematic to PNG, including pictures,
        without using libgdgeda.

2005-10-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * examples/gEDA_Flow.sch: Added simple PCB design flow diagram drawn
        by Stuart.

2005-10-05 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * noweb/o_net.nw: added the patch from David Carr.
        when drawing a net, there will be two segments in an L-shape.
        the shift-key changes the drawing path.

2005-10-04 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: removed gettext makro from a programm string

2005-09-30 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/o_misc.nw, noweb/i_callbacks.nw:
        Added code to embed/unembed pictures.

2005-09-30 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/i_basic.nw: Added missing check.

2005-09-30 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/i_basic.nw: Fixed memory leak which maked gschem to segfault
        when adding pictures. Undid the last patch made by Dan (a NULL string
        is not the same as a "" string, so it maked gschem segfault), and
        changed the g_strdup_printf("") to g_strdup(""). This fixes the
        compiler warning Dan wanted to fix.

2005-09-27 18:38  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * docs/gschemdoc.texi: add title to remove warnings

2005-09-27 18:36  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/: i_basic.nw, o_misc.nw: remove various compiler warnings

2005-09-09 08:05  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: don`t declare variables in the middle of
          functions.  Not all compilers like that.

2005-09-05 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_image.nw: Applied patch by Michael Hanselmann which
        makes sure that proportions are preserved when exporting a
        schematic to a PNG file.  Thanks for the bug fix.

        * po/it_IT.po: Updated the Italian translation by Petrecca Michele.

2005-08-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/it_IT.po: Updated the Italian translation by Petrecca Michele.

2005-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text.nw, x_dialog.nw: Applied Matthias Wenzel`s color
        and usability patch.  Thanks.  The Edit/Color... dialog now makes
        the selected object`s color the default color in the dialog box and
        the Edit/Text Edit... dialog box has the color selector.

        * noweb/x_event.nw: Fixed a long standing crash that if you disable
        the scrollbars and tried to scroll with a wheel button, gschem will
        crash.  You cannot disable the scrollbars and still scroll with the
        wheel.  This is an unfortunate effect of how the scroll wheel code
        is implemented (it needs the scrollbars to exist).

        * configure.ac: Bumped the package version to 20050820 which will be
        a real snapshot.

2005-08-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, g_register.nw, i_vars.nw: Added
        g_rc_grid_fixed_threshold, g_rc_grid_mode and
        g_rc_add_attribute_offset (which isn`t used yet)

        * noweb/x_grid.nw: Added implmentation for fixed grid mode and
        threshold (control by grid-mode and grid-fixed-threshold keywords).

        * configure.ac: Updated package version to 20050814.  This is a
        temporary version and not a real release number.

2005-08-04 22:49  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * include/globals.h, noweb/globals.nw, noweb/parsecmd.nw,
          noweb/x_log.nw, noweb/x_window.nw: add a new commandline option
          '-p' which automatically places the main gschem window and the
          gschem log window at startup time rather than letting the window
          manager figure out what to do.  This is useful when doing batch
          processing of schematics and you want to call gschem several
          times with no manual interaction.

2005-06-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/globals.h, noweb/global.c: Removed a completely bogus
        extern declaration and variable.  Reported by Wojciech Kazubski.
        Thanks.

2005-06-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/i_vars.nw, x_window.nw: Fixed a long standing bug
        found in the OSX which prevented the full world space to used.
        Basically a variable was defined twice, once in libgeda and once
        in gschem.  Apparently OSX behaves very differently when this
        happens (the two variables are different while other platforms
        didn`t complain but the "right" thing happened).  This bug was
        created when the rc code was refactored.

2005-03-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Removed all tests for gtk+ 1.2.x and fixed error
        message if gtk+ 2.2.x is not found.

2005-03-12 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/nl_NL.po: Checked in updated Dutch translation from
        Bert Timmerman.  Thanks Bert.

        * po/nl_NL.po: Also converted file to UTF-8, even though there
        was no conversion necessary.  This is to be consistent with the other
        translations.

2005-03-12  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * po/es_ES.po: updated spanish translation.

2005-03-10  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Made it close the dialog on a key press
        of Escape.

2005-03-09 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * po/de_DE.po: updated translation
        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: added refdes=U to the list, removed
          gettext brackets

2005-03-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20050313

        * po/POTFILES.in: For some odd reason, the list of files in this
        file was really out of date, so updated it.

        * Ran make dist to update geda-gschem.pot

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw: Fixed uninitialized variable warning

2005-03-05 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * noweb/o_misc.nw: added error handling for missing source pages
        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: swapped apply and close button position

2005-03-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * tests/Makefile.am: Added missing files to EXTRA_DIST

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Fixed hotkey for Autonumber Text... dialog
        box to be unique (so it will even work; hasn`t worked since 01/2001).

        * noweb/gschem.c: Fixed code to allow user to specify absolute
        filenames on the command line again.

        * tests/agile-vfo-block_1.sch: Moved schematic into test directory
        since it`s out-of-date.

2005-03-05 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: changed the autonumber_text dialog
        * noweb/o_misc.nw: changed functions which support the autonumber
                dialog

2005-03-05 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/gschem.nw:
          Removing call to o_text_init, since it`s now called in libgeda_init.

2005-02-28  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * po/es_ES.po: updated spanish translation.

2005-02-28  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * scripts/notangle_guile.in: Improved script with changes suggested
        by Thien-Thi Nguyen.

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw (multiattrib_callback_edited_name)
        (multiattrib_callback_edited_value): Added code to check for changes
        in a slot attribute.

        * noweb/x_log.nw (x_log_open): Fixed to actually raise the dialog.

2005-02-27  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw (i_callback_hierarchy_down_symbol): Changed
        to exclude embedded symbols from the hierarchy feature.

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Modified dialog to make it possible to
        set multi-line values at adding of attributes.
        Changed the behavior of the value column to stop edition when
        hitting the Enter key: for a new line, use Ctrl+Enter.

2005-02-26  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw (x_multiattrib_open): Fixed bug #153 (first
        reported by Ales): added missing reset of toplevel`s state at
        closing of dialog.
        Created a new CellRenderer for multi-line cells. It is used by the
        column 'value' of the attributes list.
        (multiattrib_callback_edited_name): Added a check on the future
        attribute`s name: reject empty names and issue a message.

2005-02-25 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * noweb/o_misc.nw: fixed autonumber_text

2005-02-24  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Removed unused variables and fixed a couple
        of gcc warnings.

        * noweb/g_funcs.nw (hash_table_2_list): Replaced deprecated guile
        functions with their equivalents in the new scm interface.

        * scripts/notangle_guile.in: New version.

        * configure.ac, scripts/Makefile.am: Adapted for renaming of script.

        * scripts/notangle_guile.scm.in: Renamed to notangle_guile.in.

2005-02-22  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/x_log.nw: Fixed to work with GTK 2.2.

2005-02-21  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/o_misc.nw (o_edit): Adapted for new dialog.

        * include/x_multiattrib.h: New file for the new x_multiattrib.nw.

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Modified the dialog to remove deprecated
        widgets and enable edition of attributes directly from the list.

        * noweb/x_pagesel.nw: Added a context-sensitive menu to the list of
        pages and a label below for information.

2005-02-21 04:11  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw: remove unused variable

2005-02-21 04:10  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/x_log.nw: add a missing GTK_TEXT_VIEW ()

2005-02-21 04:06  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/x_pagesel.nw: specify return type for some static functions

2005-02-21 03:58  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * autogen.sh: avoid using the '-path' primary to find(1) as it`s an
          extension to posix.2 and is not supported on some operating
          systems such as solaris.  Now we can autogen.sh on solaris 9.

2005-02-21 03:07  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/o_text.nw: fix some format string/type mismatch bugs

2005-02-21 03:07  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw: comment out some unused variables which are part
          of commented out code

2005-02-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_log.nw: Added code to scroll to the end of the text buffer
        when the log window is opened up.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw: Added implementation for the add_picture_hotkey
        callback.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added hotkey assignment "ag" to
        Add/Picture... and move the new item to the bottom of the menu list.

        * noweb/x_menu.nw: Applied part of a patch from Patrick Ammann to
        add "Add/..." in front of some of the commands in the popup menu.

2005-02-20  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw, noweb/gschem.nw: Adapted for new logging
        system.

          Added picture support.

2005-02-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/fr_FR.po, LINGUAS: Added French translation by Iznogood.

2005-02-14 22:29  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/x_preview.nw: add missing header file needed for chdir()

2005-02-13  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/g_keys.nw (g_get_selected_component_attributes): Adapted for
        new prototype of get_selected_component_attributes.
        (g_get_selected_filename): Adapted for new prototype of
        get_selected_filename;

        * noweb/g_funcs.nw (get_selected_component_attributes): Rewritten to
        use a GLib hash table instead of the libgeda s_scratch code. Also
        reduced number of parameters.
        (get_selected_filename): Reduced number of parameters.

2005-02-13  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * po/es_ES.po, po/LINGUAS: Added first version of spanish translation.

2005-02-13  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, noweb/x_pagesel.nw:
          Commented out the code defining the "Discard page" button,
          so it doesn`t appear in the page manager.
          Added new function "e_gtk_button_new_with_icon" which allows
          to create a button with a given text, and an icon from the GTK
          stock. Which is the right file to include such a generic function?
          If texts like "Add page" are preferred in the buttons, then
          there is only needed to comment a line, and uncomment another.
          See the code of pagesel_init pagesel function.

        * noweb/gschem.nw, noweb/i_callbacks.nw, noweb/o_undo.nw:
        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw, noweb/x_window.nw: Changed for new page
        manager.

        display.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw, noweb/o_undo.nw, noweb/x_fileselect.nw:
        * noweb/x_image.nw, noweb/x_preview.nw: Adapted for new toplevel and
        page APIs in libgeda.

        * noweb/x_window.nw: Refactored to avoid duplication of code with
        libgeda.

2005-02-08 22:28  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/g_register.nw: replace deprecated guile functions with
          approved guile-1.6.6 ones

2005-02-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/ *.nw: Made it use GLib`s G_DIR_SEPARATOR* instead of
        libgeda`s *_SEPARATER_*.
        Replaced u_basic_strdup() and u_basic_strdup_multiple() by GLib
        functions.

          noweb/x_attribedit.nw, noweb/x_fileselect.nw, noweb/x_image.nw,
          noweb/x_print.nw, noweb/x_script.nw: - lots of clean up of
          'const' usage.  Seems to have squished all   gcc warnings around
          const.  Mostly this involved adding lots of        missing const`s.  -
          also add a few missing prototypes and header files.  - fix call
          to realpath (it was being given a pointer to a pointer rather
          than a pointer).

2005-02-01  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/ *.nw: Switched to the new scm interface of guile.

2005-01-29  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/gschem.nw, noweb/o_misc.nw:
        * noweb/o_net.nw, noweb/x_fileselect.nw: Adapted for new component
        library code.

2005-01-28  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * noweb/x_preview.nw:  Incorporated patch from Patrick Bernaud.

2005-01-27  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * include/prototype.h, noweb/gschem.nw, noweb/i_callbacks.nw,
        noweb/x_fileselect.nw, noweb/x_preview.nw, noweb/x_window.nw:
        Changes made to enable correct opening
        of schematics in foreign directories.  New algorithm:

        1.  Take the filename the user wants to open.
        2.  Turn it into an absolute path, like /foo/bar/baz.sch
        3.  From the path, figure out the directory, /foo/bar
        4.  From this, create the absolute path to the local gafrc,
            /foo/bar/gafrc.
        5.  cd to /foo/bar
        6.  read /foo/bar/gafrc while sitting in the directory /foo/bar.
            This takes care of all the guile search path problems,
            like when people put things like
            (component-library "../common/symlib") or some such into
            their RC files.
        7.  After that, read the file itself.
        8.  Leave the directory set to this directory.

2005-01-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * tests/missing.sch, Makefile.am: Added test schematic to test
        missing component rendering.

        * tests/symversion3.sch: Added components which have no attributes
        (one in the middle of the file and one at the end).  This tests a
        but which has been fixed in libgeda dealing with symversion= handling.

2005-01-23  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw (x_fileselect_comp_fill_components): Removed
        the duplicate message of failure to open directory. It also fix the
        problem reported by Bob Paddock.

2005-01-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw, o_buffer.nw, o_bus.nw, o_complex.nw, o_copy.nw,
        o_cue.nw, o_delete.nw, o_misc.nw, o_move.nw, o_net.nw, x_attribedit.nw:
        Added code to make OBJ_PLACEHOLDER a first class object/citizen
        (it is rendered and can be manipulated to some degree in gschem)

2005-01-16  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * noweb/i_basic.nw, noweb/x_menus.nw: incorporated right
        mouse button bring-up of "up hierarchy", as requested.

2005-01-15  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * noweb/(gschem.nw, i_basic.nw, x_event.nw, x_menus.nw,
        w_window.nw): Various changes made to enable right-button-
        mouse bring up of hierarchy menus.  Made hierarchy menus grey
        out when no components are selected.

        * noweb/x_log.nw, include/prototype.h: changed x_log_init
        to take const char as arg since it`s always called with a
        quoted string.

2005-01-14 Handsome Greg <xdissent@gmail.com>

        * noweb/g_keys.nw: Replaced all g_key_ functions with g_keys_X
        and changed associated makefile generation scripts and docs to
        reflect this change. (fixes Gtk/Glib-2.6.0). Applied by Ales,
        the following files changed:
                M include/prototype.h
                M docs/gschemdoc.texi
                M src/Makefile.am
                M docs/Makefile.am
                M noweb/Makefile.am
                A noweb/g_keys.nw
                R noweb/g_key.nw
                M noweb/g_register.nw
                 M noweb/x_event.nw

2005-01-08  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Added symbol name to items displayed
        in multiattrib dialog box.

2005-01-07  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw (x_fileselect_comp_fill_components)
        (x_fileselect_search_library): Updated for the new s_clib_getfiles()
        that fixes file number limitation.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw
        (i_callback_edit_embed, i_callback_edit_unembed): Updated for new
        o_embed() and o_unembed().

        * noweb/o_misc.nw (o_embed, o_unembed): Cleaned-up code, changed
        prototype to take a single object and make it issue a message to
        log when done.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw (i_callback_edit_filltype): Modified to
        create a list of relevant objects that is passed to
        fill_type_dialog.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw (fill_type_dialog*): Rewrote code for this
        dialog to work one more than a single object (on the model of
        line_type_dialog).

        * noweb/o_misc.nw (o_update_component): Added initialization of
        attribute list and a redraw for each new attribute object.

2005-01-04 Stuart Broson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * lib/system-gschemrc: Changed system-commonrc to system-gafrc.

2005-01-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/i_vars.h, prototype.h, noweb/g_rc.nw, g_register.nw,
        i_vars.nw, lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added a new keyword
        "output-vector-threshold" which controls the minimum number lines
        (in a multi-line text object) that are output using the postscript
        font.  If the threshold (in number of lines) is exceeded then
        the multi-line text item is output using the vector font.

2005-01-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw (i_callback_edit_linetype): Modified to create
        a list of relevant objects that is passed to line_type_dialog.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw (line_type_dialog*): Rewrote most of the code
        for the line type dialog. Now it applies to more than a single
        object.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw (i_callback_edit_update): Adapted for the
        new o_update_component().

        * noweb/o_misc.nw (o_update_component): Rewritten function to
        avoid duplication of attributes when updating. Prototype change to
        take a single object as second argument.

2004-12-28 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/it_IT.po: Added the Italian translation by Petrecca Michele.
          Thanks!

        * noweb/o_misc.nw: Fixed one possible cause for a crash when updating
        components.  Also started adding the other two requested modes of
        update component (delete and intelligent replace).  These two other
        modes are not functional yet.

        * noweb/x_grid.nw, i_vars.nw, g_rc.nw, g_register.nw,
        lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added the ability to adjust the grid
        dot size via the "grid-dot-size" rc keyword.

2004-12-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20041228

2004-10-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added comment to attribute list.

2004-07-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * tests/versionsym1.sch versionsym2.sch versionsym3.sch
        versionsym_basic.sym versionsym_invalid.sym versionsym_major.sym
        versionsym_minor.sym versionsym_minor2.sym: Added a bunch of
        test schematic for the symversion attribute

        * tests/gafrc: Added the first global rc file for all gaf tools.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added symversion= to the attribute list
        keyword.

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Added call to put up an error dialog box if there
        are symbols which have changed too much.

        * noweb/x_window.nw: Added code to free up the list of changed
        refdes (symbols which have changed too much are put into a list which
        the major changed dialog displays).

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Added code to implement the symbol has "changed
        majorly" dialog box.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Added some code to make the new dialog box
        work with gtk+ 1.2.x.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw: Added a question dialog box when reverting
        a page.  I lost several schematics because I accidentally hit page
        revert (you cannot undo a page revert).  This dialog box is only
        implemented for gtk+ 2.2.x

        * tests/versionsym*.sch: Minor updates

2004-07-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: spelling and grammar fixes

        * include/Makefile.am, include/papersizes.h: Moved papersizes.h
        into libgeda and fixed makefile for this change.

        * noweb/ *.nw: Removed reference to papersizes.h include file
        (now inside of libgeda).

        * include/i_vars.h, prototype.h, noweb/g_rc.nw, g_register.nw,
        gschem.nw, i_vars.nw: Removed a whole bunch of rc related code.
        The removed code was moved into libgeda.

        * noweb/g_rc.nw: Added g_rc_parse_gtkrc() as a special parse
        routine for gschem only.

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040710

2004-05-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Removed a false comment from the comment
        block around sort-components-library.  Pointed out by Andreas Fester.

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Added an #ifdef HAS_GTK22 around the call to
        gtk_disable_locale call, since it is gtk+ 2.2.x specific.

        * include/prototype.h noweb/x_event.nw noweb/x_window.nw: Applied
        scrolled wheel patch by Sascha Silbe.  Thanks!

        * noweb/x_event.nw, x_window.nw: Added #ifdef HAS_GTK22 since
        these functions used are gtk+ 2.2.x specific.  Also added some
        code that if you hold down the control key and scroll in the
        vertical direction, you will pan left or right.  This is for
        people who don`t have two scroll wheels.

2004-05-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Applied patch (with additional comments) to
        fix gtk`s desire to override LC_NUMERIC which breaks the postscript
        output (by changing periods to commas).  Original fix by Bill Wilson,
        patch by Andreas Fester.  Thanks.

2004-01-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw: Moved the component option combo menu into
        the vbox to fix the garbage which people have been seeing.  Turns
        out that if the combomenu is in the searchbox, then the preview
        drawing area gets resized which is not permited (otherwise you
        get garbage).  Pointed out and fixed by Carlos.  Thanks.

        * noweb/x_preview.nw: Removed the gtk+ 1.2.x hack, because the
        above fixed it for both gtk+ 1.2.x and 2.2.x.

        * config.h.in: Remove machine generated file.

2004-01-11 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Added a call to the scrollbar update code to fix
        the "scrollbars are wrong on startup" bug.

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040111

        * noweb/i_basic.nw o_slot.nw o_text.nw x_fileselect.nw x_image.nw:
        Fixed most -Wall warnings

2004-01-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * tests/multiline3.sch: Added another test schematic for the
        multiline code (mainly for PS testing)

2004-01-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * tests/ext_chars.sch: Added all the new spanish characters by
        Carlos to the test schematic.

        * docs/gschem.1: Spent a little time fixing up the man page.

        * examples/ *.sch: Updated most schematics to the last file format
        version.

2004-01-01 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_preview.nw: Set the size of all preview windows to the
        minimum of 160x136.  Even though this does not have the right
        aspect ratio, it does get rid of some garbage that was showing up
        when using gtk+ 1.2.x.  gtk+ 1.2.x was ignoring my specification of
        160x120 and instead setting the window size to 160x136.  This change
        is only for gtk+ 1.2.x, gtk+ 2.2.x uses 160x120 and allows this size.

        * configure.ac: Added --with-docdir command line flag as well all
        the code to support installing documentation.  Also added a prog
        check for groff.

        * docs/Makefile.am: Added commands to generate an html version
        of the man page.  This html man page gets installed into the
        documentation directory.

        * docs/gschem.1: Minor updates and fixes.

        * noweb/x_window.nw: Fixed a very long standing bug identified by
        Karel Kulhav which deals with opening up a schematic, then a
        new window and then opening a new schematic or closing the new
        window.  The bug was that the wrong window will get the open or
        close event.  The fix was to change enter_notify event to be the
        main window and not the drawing_area.  Thanks for the bug report
        Karel.

2003-12-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Moved some code around to fix a memory
        leak.

        * include/prototype.h: Added missing function prototype.

        * tests/attributes.sch: Added test schematic specifically for all
        the different types of valid/invalid attributes.

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20031231

        * m4/Makefile.am: Added some missing *.m4 files to EXTRA_DIST.

2003-12-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text.nw: Fixed the quick text rectangle to be the right
        size using the new displayed_width and displayed_height variables
        in the st_text structure.

        * noweb/o_text.nw: Refactored the quick text rectangle rendering
        code into its own function.  Added some #if 0'ed code in prep for a
        future performance enhancement.

        * noweb/x_log.nw: Further refined the appearance of the log/status
        dialog box.

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw: Integrated Stuart`s multiple select/open
        code changes.  Thanks Stuart. You can now pick multiple files from
        the file list and they will all be opened.  Use the shift and
        control keys to pick the individual files.


2003-12-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/pt_BR.po: Replaced file by new UTF-8 version provided by
        Antonio.

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Applied a patch by Carlos to add
        multi line attribute editing.  This work should also be
        ported to the single attribute add/edit dialog box.

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Improved the appearance of the
        new GtkTextView by placing it into a GtkViewport which provides
        a nice border.  Not sure this is the most correct way of doing
        this, but it does work.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Applied the same appearance fix to the
        add text and edit text dialog box.  Put some white space around
        the edit text dialog box to make it look a little better.  The
        edit text dialog box needs a major overhaul.

        * noweb/x_log.nw: Also added a viewport to the log/status dialog box.
        Changed the large close button to an edge aligned button and
        increased the size of the log/status dialog box.

        * noweb/x_print.nw, x_attribedit.nw: Various appearance improvements.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Added border space to almost all most
        dialog boxes.  They look a little better now.

        * tests/multiline.sch, multiline2.sch: Added and improved these
        test schematics to test the postscript printing code.

2003-12-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated to gettext 0.12.1

2003-11-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_menus.nw: Fixed the alignment of the hotkeys in the pull
        down menus to be mostly correct when using gtk+ 2.2.x.  This involved
        using Pango.

        * noweb/x_menus.nw: Removed some old dead code.

2003-11-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * config.guess config.rpath config.sub depcomp install-sh missing
        mkinstalldirs: Removed machine generated files from cvs.

        * Makefile.am: Added above files to maintainer-clean target

        * autogen.sh: Added script to generate all the auto* files.

2003-10-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Fixed missing #include <locale.h>.  Pointed
        out by Karel Kulhav.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Applied Carlos` patch to fix the text
        alignment dialog box so that it show the correct item in the
        options menu.

2003-10-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h, noweb/g_funcs.nw,
        noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/g_register.nw, noweb/i_vars.nw,
        noweb/x_image.nw, scripts/image.scm:  Added the ability to
        generate images (png) of schematics from the command line:
        gschem -o test.png -s image.scm filename.sch

        * noweb/g_rc.nw: Added rc keyword: (image-size width height)

        * noweb/g_funcs.nw: Added new gschem command: gschem-image
        which outputs a png to a file.

        * noweb/g_key.nw, g_rc.nw, gschem.nw, i_basic.nw, o_misc.nw,
        o_net.nw, o_slot.nw, o_text.nw, o_undo.nw, x_attribedit.nw,
        x_dialog.nw, x_fileselect.nw, x_grid.nw, x_image.nw, x_menus.nw,
        x_multiattrib.nw, x_print.nw, x_stroke.nw, x_window.nw:
        Applied Carlos Nieves Onega`s multi-line text patch.  Thank you
        Carlos!  The next items are the all changes from Carlos` patch
        and my integration changes.  The changes happened over a period
        of a few weeks, but were checked in on the above date.

        * noweb/g_key.nw: Removed a couple fixed sized character buffers.

        * noweb/g_key.nw: Rearranged g_key_execute() to avoid a possible
        memory leak.  Removed some ancient code.

        * noweb/g_rc.nw: Added the word "optional" to the ~/.gEDA/gschemrc
        and local gschemrc warning message if these files are not found.
        Added "required" to the system-gschemrc message.

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Fixed memory leak due to default_bus_ripper_symname
        not being freed on exit.

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Removed a fixed size character buffer.

        * noweb/i_basic.nw: Removed a few fixed size character buffers.
        Fixed a possible core dump.

        * noweb/o_misc.nw: Fixed the attribute edit detection code to
        only start the attribute editor for one line text attributes.

        * noweb/o_misc.nw: Fixed up references to o_text_height (takes
        string and does not take w_current anymore).

        * noweb/o_misc.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer.

        * noweb/o_net.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer.

        * noweb/o_slot.nw: Fixed up a call to o_attrib_get_name_value to
        use the new function signature.

        * noweb/o_slot.nw x_multiattrib.nw x_attribedit.nw: Added some checks
        to make sure valid pointers are freed (everywhere
        o_attrib_get_name_value) is called.

        * noweb/o_text.nw: Changed the quick text drawing code to draw
        a rectangle instead of a single line now that text can be multiple
        lines long.

        * noweb/o_text.nw: Fixed a minor typo (was outline_xor_gc instead
        of just gc).

        * noweb/o_undo.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer.

        * noweb/x_attribedit.nw: Fixed up a few of calls to
        o_attrib_get_name_value to use the new function signature.
        Also initalized two pointers to null, so they wouldn`t be
        attempted to be freed.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Added select_all_text_in_textview and
        text_view_calculate_real_tab_width utillity functions.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Converted the text_input_dialog and
        text_edit_dialog boxes to use the new gtk+ 2.2.x GtkText API to
        provide a way of entering multiple lines of text.  This is only
        available when using gtk+ 2.2.x.  The old single line interface
        is still there for users of gtk+ 1.2.x.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Remove a fixed size character buffer in the
        alignment menu, linetype menu, line type dialog box, fill type
        menu, fill type dialog box, text size dialog box, snap size dialog
        box, about dialog box, coord update dialog box, and color menu.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Moved a few activate signal connects to
        GTK1.2 only #ifdef sections.  This fixes a warning when using
        gtk+ 2.2.x.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Fixed a warning from gtk+ 1.2.x where a non
        scrolled widget (text entry) was being added to a scrolled window.
        Fixed by making the scrolled window for text input and text edit
        dialog boxes specific to gtk+ 2.2.x.

        * noweb/x_image.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer in image
        write size menu.

        * noweb/x_menus.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer in
        guile menu execute function (g_menu_execute), and get main menu
        function (get_main_menu).

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Fixed up a call to
        o_attrib_get_name_value to use the new function signature.

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Fixed a core dump in a free call.  If a
        component with no attribute was edited, the text array would never
        be allocated, but an attempt would be made to free it.  Moved free
        code to the right spot.

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Removed two printfs

        * noweb/x_print.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer in
        orientation menu and type menu.

        * noweb/x_stroke.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer in
        x_stroke_search_execute (stroke execute function).

        * noweb/x_window.nw: Added casts around gtk+ toolbar functions.

        * examples/ *.sch: Updated all example schematics

        * noweb/x_attribedit.nw, noweb/x_dialog.nw, noweb/o_grips.nw,
        noweb/x_multiattrib.nw, noweb/o_misc.nw, noweb/o_text.nw:
        Removed all // comments (replaced with proper C comments)

        * tests/multiline.sch: Added new test schematic.

2003-10-18 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to something more recent, but this
        version is not an official release.

2003-10-11 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/prototype.h: Added #ifdef HAS_GTK22 around gtk+ 2.2.x
        specific functions.  This means the prototype file is no longer
        machine generated.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Added some more #ifdef HAS_GTK22 around
        gtk+ 2.2.x specific functions.

2003-10-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        version is not an official release.

2003-09-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * tests/ *.sch: Added a few new test schematics

        * noweb/x_print.nw: Changed the print dialog box so that it closes
        when the print button is pressed.

        * noweb/x_log.nw: Under gtk+ 2.2.x, change log window to scroll to
        the end when a new message is displayed.  This is the same behavior
        that was the default under gtk+ 1.2.x

2003-09-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw: Minor log message tweak

        * configure.ac: Added --with-stroke configure command line option
        so that users can tell the mechanism where to find libstroke.

2003-09-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Fixed MinGW cflags/ldflags

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw: Disabled the use of gschemdoc under MinGW

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Added a call to bind_textdomain_codeset to fix
        the i18n support when using gtk+ 2.2.x

        supplied libintl library.

2003-08-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Changed AC_CONFIG_HEADER to AM_CONFIG_HEADER

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Rewrote the exit dialog box to look better
        under gtk+ 2.2.x and 1.2.x

        * configure.ac: Removed the use of GUILE_PROGS as it is not part
        of guile 1.4.  Put in a manual check for guile-config.

        * examples/ *.sch: Updated schematics to 20030901

2003-08-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Oops wasn`t return true or false in the
        keypress routine, so no input was going to the entries.  Fixed.

        * noweb/x_attribedit.nw, x_dialog.nw, x_fileselect.nw, x_image.nw
        x_log.nw, x_menus.nw, x_multiattrib.nw, x_pagesel.nw, x_print.nw,
        x_window.nw:
        Add #ifdef HAS_GTK?2 depending on the gtk version so
        that the code base builds for both gtk+ 1.2.x and 2.2.x.

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, gschem.nw, x_event.nw, x_window.nw:
        Changed a few #if ... to #ifdef ...

        * noweb/x_attribedit.nw: Improved the looks of the bottom buttons
        in gtk+ 2.2.x while preserving the 1.2.x look.

2003-08-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/prototype.h, noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Applied
        Carlos Nieves O`nega`s multi attribute add/change patch.  Thanks!

        * examples/cmos-invert.sch: Minor tweak

        * src/parsecmd.c: Cleaned up help message a little.

        * docs/gschem.1: Updated manpage a little

2003-07-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Renamed from configure.in.

        * configure.ac: A whole bunch of changes to support both
        gtk+-1.2.x and gtk+-2.2.x.

        * configure.ac: Lots of cleanup and moved to the use of pkg-config
        for the configuration of almost all libraries (most importantly
        libgeda).

        * *.in, *.h, etc: Removed a bunch of old unneeded auto* files.

2003-05-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/i_basic.nw: Removed unused variable

        * noweb/o_slot.nw: Changed a include from strings.h to string.h

2003-05-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Updated version

        * examples/ *.sch: Updated to latest version

2003-04-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/pt_BR.po: Added update translation from Antonio.

2003-04-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in, noweb/Makefile.am: Removed x_multimulti.nw from the
        build and removed the dependancy on gtk+extra (also removed references
        to this file in the docs/ directory)

        * noweb/x_multimulti.nw: Removed file from CVS

2003-04-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, g_register.nw: Added reset-component-library and
        reset-source-library rc keywords.  These empty the
        component/source libraries when executed.  Useful when a user
        wants set (override) all the paths themselves from a user rc file.

2003-03-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw: Fixed bug #43: "If gschemdoc is not install,
        gschem crashes", by changing exit to _exit.  Fix by Mario Klebsch.

2003-03-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * scheme/gschem.scm: Fixed the crashing bug when you press a
        "no-action" bound key.  Patch by Dan McMahill. Thanks.

2003-02-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/i_vars.nw, noweb/x_print.nw: Applied Antonio`s
        no margin printing patch (with minor modifications).  Thanks.

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/i_vars.nw, noweb/x_print.nw: Renamed "limits" to
        "extents".

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added new example usage of the output-type
        rc keyword, and also put in a note that "limits" should no longer be
        used.

2003-02-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added comment to sort-component-library
        keyword that it is broken and that users should not use it.
        Filed bug #53.

2003-02-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw: Fixed the annoying flicker if you keep
        executing the page next/prev commands.

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Applied patchlet from Steve Tell for disabling
        the guile 1.6.3 deprecated warnings.

        * README: Added note suggestion by Steve Tell about warning users
        that deprecated guile warnings are turned off.

2003-02-18 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Bumped version to 20030223

        * noweb/g_funcs.nw, noweb/x_menus.nw, scheme/gschem.scm: Applied
        Steve Tell`s guile 1.6.3 patch. Thanks.

2003-02-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Applied Gabriel Paubert`s warning reducing patch with
        a few minor mods.

2003-01-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/ru.po: Updated version from Andy Shevchenko

        * configure.in: Changed -fnative-struct to -mms-bitfields for
        gcc 3.2 mingw compiler (older mingw compilers are no longer
        supported)

2003-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_image.nw: Added 3200x1600 to the image write dialog box.
         Suggestions by Karel Kulhavy.

2003-01-11 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_arc.nw: Applied patch by Patrick to fix Bug #45: arc`s
        being drawn incorrectly with snap on.  Thanks Patrick.

        * Makefile.am: Fixed the distclean-local target.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Fixed typo (gif->png)

2003-01-10 Chris Ellec  <chrisATgtx.seul.org>

             * noweb/o_misc.nw: Find Specific Text, replaced the strcmp used
             to search for the text with a strstr so that we can search for
             C12 instead of having to seach for refdes=C12. That way the user
             doesn`t have to know what the symbol internal names are.

2003-01-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/i_basic.nw: Hierarchy/Up should never be greyed out. Fixed.

2003-01-07 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_arc.nw: Added the first of Patrick`s suggestions to fixing
        bug #45.  Not completely fixed yet.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw: Added code to properly output a failed error
        message when executing File/Save All and one of the files cannot be
        saved.

2002-12-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * tests/ext_chars.sch: Applied Egil`s patch to add the new chars
        to this test schematic.

2002-12-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_attribedit.nw, o_undo.nw, o_misc.nw, o_delete.nw: Added
        missing calls to i_update_menus()

2002-12-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_basic.nw: Added o_draw_list() and o_draw_selected() helper
        functions (used by below change)

        * noweb/o_move.nw: Changed the behavior of move:  When you start
        the move, the objects are erased first and then the rubber outline
        is drawn.  This looks a whole lot better, but the downside is that
        it required the reordering of some operations (namely when things
        are drawn), so the change is non-trivial.

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Fixed spelling mistake: "Dettach" is not
        a word.

        * noweb/x_menus.nw: Added data (via gtk_object_set_data()) to
        the toplevel menubar.  This data is the individual menu items
        (of all menus) via the menu path.

        * noweb/x_menus.nw: Added x_menus_sensitivity which given a path
        to a menu item (using above) allows for the disabled (greyed out)
        or enabled menu item control.

        * noweb/x_menus.nw: Removed some cruft which has been around for
        too long.

        * noweb/x_window.nw: Added code to store the menubar in the
        TOPLEVEL structure.  Also called i_update_menus when the main
        window first appears.

        * noweb/i_basic.nw: Added i_update_menus, which, for now, simply
        disables or enables menu items depending on if there is something
        selected or not.  This should be improved to take into account
        what is inside the selection list.

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw, o_buffer.nw, o_complex.nw, o_find.nw,
        o_select.nw, o_text.nw: Added calls to i_update_menus to keep the
        menu item disabled/enabled state up to date.

2002-12-01 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * m4/Makefile.am: Added Makefile.in to the maintainer-clean target.

2002-11-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Changed the variable names which hold
        the paths to the data and rc directories.  Fixed all references to
        these variables.

        * noweb/gschem.nw: Applied Alexandre`s latest patch to fix
        the "i18n bug regarding LC_NUMERIC" caused by gtk_set_locale.

        * aclocal.m4: Removed file from cvs.

        * m4/Makefile.in: Removed machine generated file from cvs.

2002-11-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * gschem/noweb.nw: Applied patch by Alexandre P. Nunes for
        gtk_set_locale bug/misbehaving.

2002-11-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/ru.po, LINGUAS: Added Russian translation by Andy Shevchenko.
        Thank you.

2002-11-03  gettextize  <bug-gnu-gettext@gnu.org>

        * configure.in (AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION): Bump to 0.11.5.

2002-11-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * examples/ *.sch, tests/ *.sch: Updated schematics to the latest
        version via gschupdate

        * configure.in: Updated version to 20021103 (an official version)

        * noweb/o_net.nw, noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Got rid of some unused

        to really upgrade to the auto* tools.

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, g_register.nw, i_vars.nw, include/i_vars.h: Added
        force-boundingbox gschemrc rc variable.  Controls if the bounding
        box is used in the pin auto whichend code.

        item.

2002-10-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, g_register.nw, i_vars.nw, i_vars.h: Added the

2002-10-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_net.nw: Added o_net_add_busrippers function.  This
        function adds the bus rippers after a net addition and after a
        net is changed via the grips.

        * noweb/o_net.nw: Added calls to above in o_net_end.

        * noweb/o_net.nw: Rearranged o_net_end a little to accommodate the

        components

        * tests/oldsym2.sch: Added an old single pin symbol, to test that
        the auto whichend code handles the single pin correctly.

        * noweb/ *.nw, include/ *.h: Intergrated patch from Egil for
        "Snap Off" and "Show Hidden" status indicators (originally written
        on 10/09/2002).

        * configure.in, *.m4: Upgraded to automake 1.7.1 and autoconf 2.54

2002-10-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_cues.nw: Added patch by Egil Kvaleberg to prevent core
        dumps when whichend is somehow invalid (added checks in libgeda
        so this really should NEVER happen).

        * tests/oldsym.sym: Added test .sym which tests the auto whichend
        code in libgeda (for older <= 20020825 symbols).  The whichends on
        all the pins should always be correct.  Do not update this file to
        the current gEDA/gaf file format ever.

        * configure.in, docs/gschem.txt, include/prototype.h,
        lib/system-gschemrc.in, noweb/g_key.nw, noweb/g_register.nw,
        noweb/i_callbacks.nw, noweb/rcstrings.nw, noweb/x_menus.nw,
        noweb/x_multiattrib.nw: Added Egil Kvaleberg`s find documentation
        patch.

2002-10-09 Egil Kvaleberg       <egil@kvaleberg.no>

        patch by Egil Kvaleberg.  Removed "name" from attribute-name list.

2002-09-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_menus.nw: Fixed the code so that toplevel menu names are
        now translated.  Also fixed it so that "Help" gets translated as
        well.

2002-09-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * po/de_DE.po: Updated the Project-Id-Version so that gettext is
        happy (I hope).

        * noweb/rcstrings.nw: Added the toplevel menu items into this file
        so that they can be translated.

        * po/ *.po: Removed geda-gschem.pot which caused the translation files
        to be rebuilt.

2002-09-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_attribedit.nw, x_dialog.nw, x_fileselect.nw: Added a few

        Antonio and Alexandre sent me.

        * tests/pins.sch: Added test schematic which exercises the pin
        whichend flag

        * noweb/rcstrings.nw: Added file which contains all the strings
        which are related to the menus so that they get translated.
        The strings are surrounded by _(" ").  This file is NOT built.

        * noweb/Makefile.am: Added above file to EXTRA_DIST=

        * po/ *: Updates to the files from rcstrings.nw

2002-09-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        components a refdes.

        * configure.in: Bumped version to 20020922, which is NOT a release.

        * noweb/o_pin.nw: Added a call to draw the cues with pin`s draw.
        This may affect rendering performance a little.  This call is needed
        to update pin`s new cues when an object is selected/unselected.

        * noweb/o_pin.nw: Added default parameters for pin_type and whichend
        when adding a pin.

        * noweb/o_cue.nw: Added code to draw the new pin dangling cues.

        * noweb/o_cue.nw: Added an if in various places so that only the
        appropriate cue (based on whichend) is drawn or erase.  This gets
        rid of a very annoying visual artifiact which was driving me nuts:
        parts of symbols were being erased when a connection was being made
         at the WRONG end.

2002-09-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/globals.c: Added variable_set_func and quit_func.  These

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Improved the label which appears on top of the
        Text entry dialog box.

        * noweb/o_arc.nw, o_attrib.nw, o_box.nw, o_bus.nw, o_circle.nw,
          o_grips.nw, o_line.nw, o_net.nw, o_pin.nw, o_select.nw, o_text.nw:

2002-05-12 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw and friends: Added warp cursor rc keyword and support
        to disable the warping of the cursor when zooming

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Changed the hotkeys for the above items
         to be under the Attribute/ menu)

        * noweb/g_rc.nw: Missed a few hardcoded /`s, fixed.

        * noweb/x_event.nw: Added a few lines of code to support the double

        port

2002-04-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in and friends: More work on getting the upgrade of
        autoconf, automake, and libtool to behave correctly.

        * configure.in: Added PATHSEP variable which holds the proper path
        separater depending on the platform.

        * lib/system-*.in: Work on getting rc files to use above variable.

2002-04-01 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

2002-02-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in, config.h.in: Added a few checks for some
        non-portable #includes

        * configure.in: Added checks for mingw32 and disabled the
        cygwin port

2002-02-11 Ales Hvezda <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added "..." to some of the Edit/ menu
        options which popup a dialog box.

2002-02-09 Ales Hvezda <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text.nw: Improved o_text_edit_end to loop over all
        selected objects and change the text size or alignment.  If more
        than one object is selected then only change size and alignment
        and not the string.  String can only be changed if one object is
        selected.

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw, noweb/o_text.nw: If you select multiple text
        strings and you cannot edit the string, so do not give the user
        that option (I removed the text entry if the number of selected
        objects > 1)

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw: Also applied the changes that Chris Ellec
        did for checking if a save was successful to the save as
        mechanism.

        * noweb/o_select.nw: Fixed an annoying selection behavior, if you
        select stuff with the selection box while holding down the SHIFT
        key and you happen to not find anything, any previous selection
        should be unaffected.  Previous behavior was to unselect
        everything (which is wrong).

        * noweb/o_misc.nw: Added suggestion by Wojciech Kazubski for a
        function which just shows hidden text, but doesn`t toggle the
        visibility.  This new function is called o_edit_show_hidden.
        The original function is now called o_edit_make_visible.
        Added it to the rc/lib (g_*.nw) files as well.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw, o_text.nw: Further improved on above to
        draw a little "I" when showing invisible text

        * noweb/o_text.nw: Fixed the above behavior to work for text items
        within placed components.  Now you can show all hidden text on a
        schematic and see exactly what text is within a symbol! :-)

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Put in fix from Dave Lawrence wrt
        find_text_ok, redraw_all after you find no more text occurances

        * noweb/ *.nw: Removed all -Wall warnings

2002-01-24 Stefan Petersen <spe@stacken.kth.se>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Fixed bug in path when loading
          auto-uref. (geda-data => gedarcdir). Thanks to Cris Ellec for
          spotting this. Code is usually commented out.

2002-01-07 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_misc.nw: Added autonumber_text patch by Dave Lawrence.
            Reference info (from Dave):
                "Attached is a patch to the autonumber_text function that
                I wrote a while back that numbers components starting
                at the lowest unused component number >0 and skips
                used component numbers.  The earlier version started
                at the maximum used component number +1.  I assume the
                new functionality is usually what people would want..
                if not, I could make a checkbox that would allow people
                to revert to the old way if you think that would
                  be useful."

2001-11-25  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Corrected a bug about arc creation due to the
        last changes (2001-11-21) : my fault.

2001-11-21  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * configure.in, Makefile.am: Added test to use notangle_guile.scm
        if notangle is not available.

        * docs/Makefile.am: Moved the documentation generation here.

        * src/Makefile.am: Added a rule to produce prototype.h from noweb
        files and moved the documentation generation to docs/.

        * scripts/geda_totexi.in: Changed geda_totexi to geda_totexi.in
        to take benefit from the configure test on AWK. Backend updated
        to handle cross-references.

        * scripts/notangle_guile.scm.in: Added guile script to tangle
        noweb code without the whole noweb package installed.

        * noweb/o_{arc|box|circle|line}.nw: Full documentation, code
        clean-up.

        * noweb/o_grips.nw: Full documentation, code clean-up : old
        function splitted in one function for each object type. Added
        function to draw and erase grips.

        * noweb/o_{bus|net|pin}.nw: Grip stuff modified to suit new
        grip handling (described above).

        * include/prototype.h: Automatically updated after above changes.

          find text patch (hotkey for find text)

        * noweb/o_misc.nw: Added more of Dave`s patch (lowlevel support
          functions)

        * noweb/x_dialog.nw: Added more of Dave`s patch (new dialog boxes)

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added Dave`s new commands to the menu.

        * noweb/g_key.nw, g_register.nw: Added some missing hotkey scheme
          functions

        * noweb/o_misc.nw: Minor updates to the patch wrt find-text, did a
          true blue pan instead of calling set_window(...)  Also added a
          zoom extents so that the zoom is about right (still experimental)

        * src/Makefile.am: Changed the order of source file building, so that
          g_key.* is before g_register.*

2001-07-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, g_register.nw, i_vars.nw, x_window.nw:
          Added (window-size w h) keyword to make some users (including myself)
          happy and in control of the window size (instead of having
          gschem pick some always too large window size for me)

2001-07-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Cleaned up all the data dir variables (to only have
          two)

        * noweb/gschem.nw, g_rc.nw: Fixed up code to look for rc files in
          different place when specifing the rc dirs using --with-rcdir.
          This used to work, but it was broken me when I added GEDADATA

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in, noweb/gschem.nw: Added a bunch of code
          to allow the rc files to live somewhere else

        * noweb/gschem.nw, g_rc.nw: More work on getting GEDADATA and
          GEDADATARC environment variables to work right when you move
          the binaries around

        * noweb/gschem.nw, i_basic.nw, o_slot.nw, o_undo.nw, x_color.nw,
          x_grid.nw: Added patch by Dan Mcmahill for 64-bit architectures.

2001-07-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_undo.nw: Whoops was hardcoding "/tmp", should look at

          scrollbars when panning :)

        * noweb/i_callbacks.nw: Fixed the wasn`t updating connections when
          doing a symbol translate in a schematic (valid and should work)
          This still does NOT work. :(

2001-07-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Fixed all the LDFLAGS to be correct (and only link
          the libraries once)

        * configure.in: Bumped up version to 20010722

        * configure.in: More updates to get cygwin to build right

        * src/Makefile.am: Changed the order in which things are linked
          (guile last)

2001-07-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/x_fileselect.nw: Changed a constant two days ago in
          defines.h, but in the code the value was being hard coded which
          cause a very hard to find (and frustrating) bug to live.  Fixed!

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Finished adding menu items

        * noweb/x_menu.c: More work on the top menu bar code, discovered
          that some menu actions are not in the keymap (hotkey vs not), so
          had to add a third item to the menu item list (the hotkey scheme
          function)

        * noweb/ *.nw: Renamed all *zoom_limits* functions to
          *zoom_extents*

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Misc updates to some of the key mappings

          really weird aspect ratio changes.  Fixed.

        * noweb/o_basic.nw: Added a parameter to o_drawbounding which controls
          if this is the first time this function is being called for this
          operation, should improve performance a tremendous amount when
          dealing with bounding boxes (constant time to draw)

        * noweb/ *.nw: Went through all code which references
          o_drawbounding and set the above parameter to the correct value

        * noweb/o_copy.nw, o_move.nw: The bounding box (when enabled) was
          not being erased properly after doing a move or copy. Fixed.

          in the right place using GEDADATA environment variables

        * lib/gschem-systemrc.in: Changed the load of the commonrc file
          to use the GEDADATA environment variable

        * Started down the path toward using noweb (still need to integrated

2001-03-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * Got make dist and make distcheck working (means all files which are
          in CVS are in some Makefile)

        * configure.in: Added DATADIR instead of PACKAGE

2001-03-16  Stefan Petersen  <spe@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_dialog.c: Fixed a bug pointed out by Martin Benes.
          Martin also provided the bug fix.  Thanks.  Needed to init
          the "selected" data item to -1.

        * src/g_register.c: Init attrib smob stuff and defines hooks

        * src/o_complex.c, src/o_copy.c, src/o_move.c: Calls to hooks added

        * include/prototype.h: two hook support functions.

2000-07-20  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_event.c: Fixed a bug in the middle mouse button move when
          you pressed the shift key and had the mouse over an existing
          object.  Now the object is not selected.

2000-07-04  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

2000-06-27  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_undo.c: DOH! Didn`t #include <math.h> which caused rint to
          cause highly unpredictable behavior (core dumping).  Fixed

        * src/o_undo.c: Added code to look for undo save data when
          you zoom and then make a schematic change (zoom undo does not
          store state of schematic), so you have to go looking for the data.

        * src/g_rc.c: Added component-library-search rc keyword which
          implements the automatic searching and adding of component libraries
          given a directory (requested feature for Steve Williams)

        * src/g_register.c: Added code to support component-library-search
          rc keyword

        * src/g_rc.c, src/g_register.c: Added very similar code to above to
          support source-library-search rc keyword

        * src/x_dialog.c (bunch of other files): Fixed attribute add bug
          where when Add/Attribute...  is execute from the menu and the
          attribute text location is weird.

        * src/g_register.c, src/i_callbacks.c, src/g_key.c: Added new
          function add-attribute-hotkey to support above

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added add-attribute-hotkey in the appropriate
            place (in the keymapping structure)

2000-06-26  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_buffer.c: Indentation nit fixed

        * src/o_undo.c: Added a bunch of code to deal with the new object_head
          pointer in the undo struct (for doing in memory undo)

          Added code to support undo-type rc keyword

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added undo-type rc file

/ ***********************************************************************/

        * src/a_zoom.c, src/i_pan_world.c: Moved some of the redraw functions
          around

        * src/x_event.c: Changed one of the o_redraw_all_fast functions to be a
          plain old simple o_redraw_all

        * src/o_move.c: Putzed around with the NET move code case to see if
          I could improve the net_conn drawing problems.  Not much success
          though (probably broke things)

        * src/i_pan_world.c, src/a_zoom.c, src/x_event.c, src/i_callbacks.c:
          Removed o_undo_savestate from zoom and pan functions (for now,
          eventually routines need to go back in)

        * src/o_undo.c: Added a flag to the save state function which allows
          for you to just store viewport info (and not the whole schematic);
          speeds up zooming/panning a lot

        * src/o_undo.c: Fixed code so that zoom factor is calculated after
          an undo

2000-06-23  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/x_fileselect.c, src/i_callbacks.c: Removed the "unselect all
          before save" call since the lowlevel routines in libgeda now
          take care of saving primitives correctly

        * src/o_undo.c: Moved undo_* pointers into page structure

        * src/o_undo.c: Moved chunks of code into libgeda/src/s_undo.c
           (init and free function)

        * src/x_window.c: Removed o_undo* function calls (now the exist in
          s_page_* in libgeda)

        * src/o_undo.c: Added global init and clean functions

        * src/gschem.c: Added some global init and cleanup undo func calls

        * src/g_rc.c, src/g_register.c, src/i_vars.c, include/i_vars.h:
          Added code to support undo-levels and undo-control rc keywords

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added undo-levels and undo-control to
          rc file

        * src/gschem.c, src/i_callbacks.c, src/x_fileselect.c, src/x_window.c:
          Added a o_undo_savestate immediately after you open/create a new page

        * src/ *.c: Added an o_undo_savestate after all code which causes a
          schematic change

        * src/a_zoom.c, src/i_pan_world.c, src/x_events.c: Added an o_undo_savestate
          after all zoom/pan type code

2000-06-22  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_undo.c: Added new file which includes higher level undo
          management routines

        * src/x_window.c: Added undo init and free routines

        * src/o_line.c: Added first call to o_undo_savestate in o_line_end

        * src/g_key.c, src/i_callbacks.c: Added new key callbacks
          (for undo and redo)

        * src/g_register.c, lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added keys U and R for
          undo and redo

        * src/x_menus.c: Added undo and redo to the menu

2000-06-08  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_buffer.c: Fixed bug which was causing buffers which are
          pasted to be misaligned

        * src/x_dialog.c, src/o_attrib.c: Changed the bug fix with
          o_attrib_add_attrib and gschem crashing to now just not attach
          the attribute, now o_attrib_add_attrib cannot return NULL (returns
          the new text object always)

        * src/o_attrib.c: For some odd reason I wasn`t using the color
          variable in o_attrib_add_attrib, fixed that.        Also attributes
          which are floating should not be yellow (attached color),
          so they are now red which signify a floating attrib.  It is the
          user`s responsibility to change the color to something else.
          The red is meant as a warning that this attribute isn`t attached
          to anything.

2000-06-04  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Made net-consolidate enabled by default

        * src/i_vars.c: Made net_consolidate variable enabled (TRUE)

        * src/x_dialog.c: Added an if to make sure returned object from
          o_attrib_add_attrib isn`t NULL (that can happen if you try to
          attach an attribute to another text item).  This bug caused at
          least one core dump.

2000-06-03  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/g_rc.c, src/i_vars.c: Added continue-component-place *rc keyword
          (functions and variables)

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added continue-component-place keyword

2000-06-01  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/g_rc.c, src/i_vars.c: Added promote-invisible *rc keyword
          (functions and variables)

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added promote-invisible keyword

        * src/o_complex.c: Removed some lame cleverness related to the
          attribute_promotion variable (it was being used instead of a real
          flag which lead to some ambiguous code)

        * src/g_rc.c, src/i_vars.c: Added keep-invisible *rc keyword
          (functions and variables)

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added keep-invisible keyword

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Spent a little time cleaning this file up.
          (more whitespace, a few missing comments)

2000-05-29  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_complex.c: Added Martin Benes' changes which implement the
          promotion and attachment of floating attributes when you
          instanciate a component.

        * src/o_complex.c, src/g_rc.c, src/i_vars.c: Made the above
          code configureable through the *rc files (keyword:
          "attribute-promotion")

        * lib/system-gschemrc.in: Added attribute-promotion keyword (enabled by
           default)

2000-05-27  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_misc.c: Oops, had a typo in o_rotate_90 which caused boxes
          to be rotated but not drawn

        * src/x_dialog.c: In the multimulti dialog box, give the value entry
          the keyboard focus by default (when an attribute is selected)
          Written by Martin Benes

          the value entry caues the dialog box to close
          Written by Martin Benes

          entry gets a default value of "label"
          Written by Martin Benes

        * src/x_dialog.c: When adding an attribute to an object using
          the attribute add dialog box, the current mouse location is used
             as the origin point for the new text item.
          Written by Martin Benes

        * src/x_event.c: After placing a component (using the place dialog
          box), immediately starting placing the same dialog again.
          Written by Martin Benes

          enabled by default.  Let`s see if anybody complains


2000-05-22  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/i_callbacks.c: Started experimenting with the concept of global
          (across all windows/pages) buffers to hold cut and paste type
          objects

        * src/globals.c include/globals.h: Added OBJECT *buffers[10] array for

        * src/i_callbacks.c: Fixed the Attribute/Attach... segfault (added
          an if ...) (Bug pointed out by Stefan, Thanks)

        * src/i_callbacks.c: Added the ability to search for the source=
          attribute inside the symbol if it isn`t found attached to the
          outside of the symbol (omission pointed out by Thepthai Tabtieng).
          If you attach source= attribute to the outside, then inside is
          NEVER searched.

        * src/x_window.c: Oops forgot to init and destroy w_current->sewindow

          paths from my machine (installed in /usr/local ...)

2000-03-23  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_net.c: Removed the stupidity of unselecting the selection
          when we consolidate nets

        * src/o_text.c: Fixed both instances of the fast text drawing
          code for 90 and 270 rotated text (line was going the wrong
          direction).

9/25/99 Rearranged right mouse button menu (suggestion by Magnus)

9/23/99 Updated all the man pages (in all the program dirs) warning users
        to specify options first.

9/21/99 Fixed all the dialog boxes so that they listened to the WM_DELETE
        signal from the window manager

        Forgot to init iwindow to NULL

        Added a few gtk_widget_destroys to x_window_close which I forgot to
        add when I created the dialog boxes

9/20/99        Changed the project logo to GPL Electronic Design Automation instead
        of GNU ...

9/19/99 Make sure gschem runs with guile-1.3.2a

        Misplaced a bracket in x_event.c (gschem would not build if you
        did not have libstroke installed)

        Fixed all warnings

        Added OBJ_BUS and OBJ_PIN to the color change routine in the
        color edit dialog box

9/18/99        Increased world size to be much much larger.  Hopefully this won`t
        break anything.

        Fixed the extension code in i_callback.c to add the NULL character
        to the right place.

        Removed freestyle color 17, it was unnecessary, the IEC417 symbols
        can use the lock color (15).

        Fixed the grid drawing to draw the grid at the right zoom levels
        (since I doubled the world size)

9/17/99        Put some code into i_set_filename which truncates extra long
        files, so that the window size isn`t affected.

        Changed the botton status bar a bit.
                - Removed the "Mouse buttons" label
                - Change the buttons to labels

        Added the "middle-button" keywork which allows you to control what
        the middle button is assigned to do.  (also added keyword to system
        rc file)

        Added code to support the "move" mode of middle-button, which
        allows you to move stuff around by just clicking the middle button
        and moving the object.  This only work on single objects, unless
        you select the objects ahead of time and then hold the shift key
        down and click somewhere OUTSIDE of an object.

        Renamed [left|middle|right]_button to _label

        Simplifed i_update_middle_button with using the new middle_button
        variable

        Added w_current->ALTKEY (so we know if the alt key is being pressed
        or not)

        If middle-button is "action" and you hold down the ALT key, the
        object will be copied instead of moved.

        Fixed the RETURN_G_RC_MODE macro.  Added a number of entries
        parameter (size), since gschem was core dumping when you passed
        an unknown string to the mode functions.  (sizeof(mode_table)
        was always returning # of bytes, not entries.

        Made the "action" mode the default for the middle-button

        Created freestyle-color which allows the user to create generic
        colors which can be used in the schematic.  This should be used
        with great care, since these colors are not attached to any type
        of object.

        Fixed a bug in the color scheme used by the symbols, using the
        freestyle-color (color 7 which is the grid color, should not be
        used by symbols, created color 17)

9/16/99        Updated all the schematic/symbol opening functions so that only
        sch`s/sym`s which are not loaded are actually opened up.  If a
        schematic is loaded and an attempt is made to open it again, gschem
        displays the original schematic

9/14/99        Fixed a really longstanding bug, you could not close gschem by using
        window manager functions, now you can. (Matt Ettus convinced me
        to finally fix this)

9/13/99        Inited hkwindow in all x_window.c and s_project.c (all other programs)

        Fixed all example schematics to make sure they display the v*-1.sym
        symbols properly

        Remove attribute_1.sch example schematic

        Fixed a keymapping error with show hidden text (renamed show hidden
        text keymap to "n")

9/12/99        Added g_funcs_key_name which is used in the list-keys.scm script
        and in the list keys dialog box

        Added g_funcs_key_value which is used in the list-keys.scm script
        and in the list keys dialog box

        Added g_funcs_key_done which is used in the list-keys.scm script
        and in the list keys dialog box

        Added x_dialog_hotkeys dialog box

        Added above dialog box to the menu

        Modified Stefan`s list-key.scm script to fill x_dialog_hotkeys.
        It`s pretty crude, but functional

        Unmodified Stefan`s list-key.scm script and moved modified functions
        into gschem.scm

        Added hotkeys for Help/About... and Help/Hotkeys...

        Put a tear off bar on the Help menu

        Renamed Shift H (Help) to h (and change Hierarchy to Shift H) in the
        system-gschemrc file

        Adding net= attribute to the attribute selection list dialog box
        (put net in system-gschemrc.in)

9/7/99        Removed all the stupid function pointers I added yesterday

        Moved huge chunks of x_color.c into libgeda/src/s_color.c

        Cleaned up the code to reflect the above

        Re created embedded_1.sch (using all_1.sch)

        Finished up the color edit dialog box, by doing some rather
        questionable casting of int`s to int *`s.

9/6/99        Finally fixed the very broken color system, now you can allocate
        any color for any object type (bus, net, background, select color)
                - Created x_color.c
                - Removed all global colors from globals.[ch]
                  Except black and white
                - Fixed up x_window.c, gschem.c to call proper init functions
                - Fixed up g_rc.c to call proper x_color functions
                  Also fixed up g_register.c
                - Added logic bubble color keyword / variable / init
                - Fixed up rc file to use the new system (a lot of cleanup)
                - Added zoom box color keyword / variable / init
                - Updated zoom box code to use above color
                - Added lock color keyword / variable / init
                - Made output-background-color an official color
                - A few updates to make the color allocation a bit more robust
                - Created x_color_ps_string which returns the ps string
                - Changed the default select color to orange...
                - Created ptr for image color specifing
                - You now get feedback that you specified an invalid color

        With the above changes, users MUST update their rc files to use the
        new color scheme.  Things will fail badly if they try to use the old
        system

        Update all example schematic to use the text color (index for that is
        9)

        Fixed a few -1`s in the example schematics

        Almost got the color edit dialog box to work with this new color scheme


9/5/99        Removed some examples schematic from examples/ directory (moved them
        to the gnetlist/examples directory)

        Created all74_1.sch for testing purposes

9/4/99        Removed some obsolete stuff from include/globals.h

9/3/99        Update g_key to use gdk_keyval_name instead of XKeysymToString

8/31/99        Renamed ntext to text (finally)

        Updated the stroke mechanism to what Stefan suggested.  Much better

8/30/99        Fixed a bug in the print dialog box, where it wasn`t setting the state
        of the window to the previous states

        Fixed net stretch to only stretch ONE net for now

        Finally renamed all ALES -> CONN and ales -> conn

8/29/99        More work on getting bus midpoint cues to work

        Added bus_gc for bus cue drawing

        Fixed some bugs related to the visual bus cues

        Removed all warnings from the code

        Disabled bus stretching... still doesn`t work

        Fixed stretch_start so that it doesn`t try to start a stretch on
        an unsupported object

        Commented out the ps/png extension code in i_callbacks.c till it`s
        debugged (next release)

8/28/99 Lots of work to get bus midpoint cues working

8/27/99 Set the program version to 19990829 to force Ales to release
        on the 29th :)

        Updated all *.c and *.h files to have the right address for the
        FSF in the copyright/licence header

8/20/99        Fixed a really really subtle bug in i_sbox.c wasn`t checking for
        the head node.  This bug causes some rather nasty coredumps.
        Hidden for so long, because of the way the selection head node
        was being initialized in the new leaner object creation scheme.

        Finished up the below dialog box cleanup

        Changed the image size from 1280x1024 to 1280x960 in the image/png
        creation, 1280x960 is the right aspect ratio.

        Temporarily disabled the extension replacement code in ps and image
        creation till it gets fixed.  Default filename: output.*

8/19/99 Added x_create_dialog_box which is basically just like gtk_dialog_new
        but will hopefully clean up the code and this will work on the
        Windows platform.

        Replaced all instances of gtk_dialog_new with x_create_dialog_box

8/18/99        Added output-capstyle keyword which control the cap style for
        postscript output

        Added the idea of an invalid connection to pins
                Added o_ales_draw_invalid which draws the invalid cue
                Added code to o_pin to use above new function

        Removed some old code from o_ales.c

        Fixed a minor bug when writing an image, wasn`t removing .sch
        from filename

8/17/99        Started adding bus object
                Added all bus base code
                Update system-gschemrc.in file

8/12/99 Fixed inconsistant naming of some g_key_*/i_callback_* functions
        (pointed out by Kazu Hirata, thanks)

        Started integrating crude net stretch code into the official devel
        source tree
                Added o_stretch.c to dist
                Update x_states.h to include STRETCH event state enums
                Added o_ales_find_closest
                Added stretch callbacks (i_callbacks/g_key_*/x_menu.c)
                Added event state machine code (x_event.c)
                Added key to keymapping in rc file
                Filled in some missing functionality

        Finish getting the above net stretch working, mostly.

8/5/99  Added some stuff to configure.in for win32 builds

        Added some misc #ifdefs to support the CYGWIN32 port

8/3/99  Added net-consolidate keyword to the rc file, controls if the
        net consolidation code is used or not.

        Fixed a very minor bug in x_attrib.c (dealing with order of which
        attribute combined name/value string)

        Upgraded to libtool 1.3.3

        Due to the unfinishedness of net consolidation, it is turned off by
        default

8/1/99  Removed my_strdup() from i_vars.c and o_comples.c. (by Kazu Hirata)

7/31/99 Cleaned up *.c. (by Kazu Hirata)

7/27/99 Added o_net_consolidate_segments to o_net_end (so that when you
        draw nets, you get the minimum number of net segments (if possible))

7/25/99 Cleaned up r_gc.c and i_callbacks.c. (by Kazu Hirata)

7/21/99 Found an attribute in test_verilog.sch to be attached to two
        objects, fixed.

        Removed all traces of s_passing.h

7/16/99 Cleaned up i_sbox.c and i_vars.c o_ales.c (by Kazu Hirata)

        Increased world coord space to 120x90, don`t know if there are any
        side effects of this.

        Increased the max zoom factor to 256

        Changed x_grid to be draw grid the grid at a larger zoom factor

        Reverted back to previous world coord space, adjusting above to
        match.  Not ready for a change yet.

7/15/99 Added support for libgdgeda 1.6 (mainly means searching for libpng)

        Removed all traces of old libgdgeda 1.5 gif support replaced it with
        png support

        Changed menu name from Write Image... to Write PNG...

        Minor bug fix in the x_image dialog box code (o_redraw_all in the
        wrong place)

7/14/99 Wrote functions to handle file name extention in i_callback.c.

        Fixed a memory leak in g_funcs_print(). (by Kazu Hirata)

7/13/99 Cleaned up i_callbacks.c (by Kazu Hirata)

7/12/99 Moved the core of i_pan_world into i_pan_world_calc

        Implemented the zoom and pan to where the mouse is (center at the
        current mouse location).  Only works with the hotkeys.

        Added i_callback_*_zoom_in_hotkey and *_zoom_out_hotkey

7/11/99 Chnaged the return values of the Scheme functions in g_*.c from
        0 and -1 to #t and #f.

        Cleaned up gschem.c and i_basic.c. (by Kazu Hirata)

7/11/99 Cleaned up i_pan_world.c, a_zoom.c, g_key.c, g_funcs.c. (by Kazu Hirata)

7/10/99        Updated a few places where it`s important to call set_window
        (part of the math speed improvements)

        Put in code that controls if text is either: xored (completely drawn)
        when doing a copy/move/place (the outline that`s dragged) or
        a simple line is drawn.  This makes the placing/copying/moving of
        large symbols faster

        Added an rc keyword to control above: text-feedback
        (either only-when-readable or always)

        Added text-display-zoomfactor to *rc file (control at which zoom factor
        text is displayed completely during operations like copy/move/place)

        Removed some // comments (should not use // comments in general)

7/6/99         Didn`t really disable libgdgeda when using --disable-gdgeda
        Now fixed.

7/5/99        Added in manually configure.in patch Manu provided to help in his
        rpm building procedures

        Added pintype to attribute-name list in system-gschemrc

        Slightly rearranged attribute-name list

        Fixed all warnings

        Fixed some misc problems in configure.in (missing if test to make sure
        libgeda-config was found)

        Got configure.in to be almost identical to gnetlist/configure.in

        Updated man page a tiny bit

7/4/99        Added updated test_verilog_1.sch to the dist from Mike Jarabek

        Added an options menu to the image write dialog box

7/3/99         Went through all sample schematic and removed all zero length/etc...
        objects

7/2/99  Fixed the ./configure stuff dealing with libgdgeda so that it works
        when libgdgeda isn`t installed in a system directory

7/1/99         Removed the libgd #include from all files (not needed)

        Fixed some stuff in configure.in (typos)

6/26/99 Fixed a bug dealing with the font-directory/scheme-directory/etc...
        which broke opening up a second window

        Fixed a visual annoyance: Place lots of components and inbetween
        each place there would be a redraw.  Not necessary.  Fixed.

6/25/99 Added the rc keyword "image-color" which controls if image is
        in color (enabled) or black and white (disabled)

        Added the start of mouse button pan.

        Added 'third-button' keyword to rc

        Added support to configure to look for optarg and friends otherwise
        include the right externs...

        Forgot to add the hotkey for Edit/Show Hidden Text

        Removed all traces of GTK_DEVEL

        Got mouse pan working, with the exception of the once it crashed my
        X server

6/24/99 Made the Image write dialog box go away once you pressed write

6/23/99 Added the first bits of support for the writing of images

        Added configure ability to find and turn off libgd support

        Added image-orientation keyword to control the future ability
        to write portrait and landscape images

6/19/99 Fixed a bug where you would select something and then visual
        cues would disappear when you hit redraw

6/10/99 Added support for this idea that hidden text is NOT created, main
        changes were in the hidding and unhidding of text items

5/31/99 Found a minor bug in move, not all nets were being redrawn

        Worked a bit more to reduce the flashing of nets/pins when a complex
        is moved

        Put a redraw in o_delete, just to make things look better after
        something is deleted

        I think I got the flashing (when doing moves under control now)

        A few updates to the sample schematics

        Added agile-vfo-block.sch to the dist finally (as an example schematic)

        Added the ability to change colors of objects from within gschem
        (finally)

        Added hotkey assignment for above dialog box

5/29/99 Worked some more on the copy operation for nets

        Added o_redraw_real (which redraws all objects given a list which
        might not be the real objects)

        Started updating the conn hash table in when nets are being drawn
                Added o_ales_draw_objects
                Added o_net_ales_erase
                Added o_net_ales_draw

        More updates to getting copy/move/rotate/mirror working for nets.

        Got copy/move/rotate/mirror working for nets only.

        Worked on getting copy/move/rotate/mirror working for pins

        Worked on getting copy/move/rotate/mirror working for complex
        objects (with contain nets/pins)

        Got pins to properly update visual cues when they are being drawn

        Got the adding of a component to update the nets properly

        Started removing the dead code from the previous connection scheme

        Tried to improve the "flashing" of net cues when you move something,
        but did not succeed.

        Added the show all hidden attributes function (useful with the new
        ability to have toplevel hidden unattached attributes)
                And everything required to implement the above

        Fixed that stupid log problem where if you couldn`t open the log
        the log window would lose it`s mind (fixed by disabling logging
        if you can`t read/write the log file)

        If logging is off or disabled, don`t show the log window on startup

5/28/99 Got ./configure working with gesym-config

        Misc integration work

5/16/99 Changed most #include`s to include stuff from <libgeda/...> since
        libgeda is now totally seperate

        #include some missing includes (in g_rc.c)

        Removed -I../include from the Makefile just to force all includes
        to be included using a ../include path or libgeda/...

        Fixed up ./configure to use libgeda-config

5/99        Removed all traces of the old connection system
        All removals should be tagged with either CONNECTION or CONN

        Added new connection (called ALES and st_ales) structures

        Got gschem to use the includes from libgeda package

        GTK+ 1.2.x is now required due to the use of
        g_hash_table_lookup_extended

        Got misc callback to print out hash table structure

        Started work on getting delete to delete nets properly

        fixed old bug when you cancelled the drawing of a net, prog would
        erase too much

        started work on getting copy to copy nets properly

        Got gschem to properly update with nets

        added comma key to gschemrc files

        Removed all conn stuff from include/struct.h

---------------- Development division starts here --------------------------

5/16/99 Removed some redundant labels from the coord window

5/14/99 Fixed an old bug dealing with the erase of the draw in progress net
        (erased way too much)

5/9/99        Removed some redundant code from o_move.c

        Fixed log-window keyword code to work with the later option.
        (didn`t work at all)

4/18/99 Added some #ifdefs to the coord dialog box so that it compiles under
        gtk+ 1.0.x

        Make sure cowindow was being set to NULL.
        (caused a core dump otherwise)

4/17/99 Fixed coord dialog box to look right

4/15/99        Added coord dialog box

        Added callbacks for above

        Added hotkey (oc) for above

4/11/99 Added some more debugging information when reading in the .scm file

        Made the log window startup when gschem is run (updated all *rc files)

        Added log-window keyword which controls if the log window is opened
        when the program starts up

        Added the ability to make the log window transient or not
        (configurable through the log-window-type keyword)
        (only works with gtk+ 1.2)

4/9/99        Fixed Makefile.am so that gschem.1 is installed

3/27/99 As a request, added a default keymapping (Delete -> edit-delete)

3/25/99 Removed all traces of i_callbacks.h from the C files (haven`t removed
        the actual include file yet)

        Changed x_window and x_menu so that those warnings about menufactory
        disappear (by using itemfactory with gtk+ 1.2.0)

        Involved adding the appropriate new functions to x_menu.c and
        modifing x_window.c

        Got rid of warning messages when you start up gschem

        With the new itemfactory stuff from gtk+ 1.2.x you can now have
        tear off menus

        Got the passing of callback data working with the menus

        Got all the popup menu i_callback_* functions to use the new callback
        parameter passing order

        Got all menu structure to work with the gtk+ 1.2.0 itemfactor
        (major pain)

        Went through and add the proper parameter passing order to *ALL*
        i_callback calls (major pain)

        Found that g_key_edit_mirror was calling the wrong i_callback function
        Fixed.

        Added some functions to x_pagesel to wrapper the i_callback_ functions
        since these i_callback_ functions were used a button click callbacks
        which take a different (the old one) function prototype.

        Missed a reference to a callback (last_callback) which is a pointer
        to a callback function, it too needs the new function prototype

        Changed the default text size in the C code to be 10, (it was 8,
        which was a really really old default value) rc file is the same as
        before (size in there is still 10)

        Added the ability to change the text size; added this to the
        Edit/Edit... dialog box

        Text size and snap size and (as before text edit) dialog boxes
        once again grab the focus for the whole app.  This is because
        they share common variables

3/23/99 Added a menu option Help/About...

        Added callback/dialog box for above

        Put the code back into use which right justified Help menu option

3/21/99 Added code to warn the user if he/she tries to translate a symbol
        and the snap_size is not set to 100.

        Minor cosmetic changes to gschem.1

3/19/99 Fixed changed flag so that when you do some attribute associated
        actions, you are prompted for a save instead of just quitting

        When opening a symbol using hierarchy, filename at the bottom
        wasn`t being set right

3/18/99 Updated g_rc_parse to use new macro for system-gschemrc file

3/17/99 Found one more instance of a uninit-ed variable (pwindow)
        (Thanks to Jeff McNeal for pointing out that things were not working
         under Solaris)

3/10/99 Fixed usage output to be somewhat more accurate

2/26/99 Fixed some labels since we are no longer supporting gtk+ 1.1.x

        Removed some duplicate strokes from the gschemrc`s

        Made the stroke output (when running with the -t flag) a bit cleaner
        (and hopefully clearer)

2/25/99 Added stroke_info_mode (enabled with -t flag) so that users can get
        stroke related info

        Misc warning updates (missing prototypes)

2/12/99 Removed the o_ntext_free_all from x_window_close (actually just moved
        it so that it only is called once, when you quit)  The call is in the
        right place now

        Added x_stroke_free_all which just frees all remaining stroke
        points

        Fixed a major bug dealing with multiple windows and the freeing of
        several common (rc strings) variables, which caused some bad behavior

        Added some more space to the above variable mallocs,
        since ccmalloc seemed to have some problems dealing with them,
        and there was enough space for the strings + null (there is now)

        Discovered why sometimes if you close a window you lose any
        subsequent log message (it`s because I was closing the log file in
        the wrong place), fixed (the call is in the right place now)

2/11/99        Added call to s_stroke_free in gschem_quit

        Forgot to set the mode label to Select mode after a zoom box, fixed

        Added stroke sequence printing if verbose mode (-v) is on

        Added x_stroke.c which contains routines to record and erase the
        stroke points

        Changed it so that stroke points are only erased when a valid stroke
        is found.  Leave invalid strokes around

        Added some more basic strokes to gschemrc

        Put back middle button repeat for when strokes are enabled.  Holding
        down the control key and pressing the middle button executes the
        repeat command.

        Added "Stroke/" to the middle button repeat button label (only if
        strokes are enabled)

        Added stroke-color keyword (controls color of the mouse droppings)

2/9/99        Started work getting stroke support into gschem (using LibStroke)
                Added stroke_init to gschem.c
                Put a #ifndef ... around some code in i_basic.c
                Added most basic support to x_event.c
                Added stroke keyword to rc files
                Added s_stroke_search_exeecute to x_event.c

        Started adding most basic strokes to gschemrc

1/31/99 Made postscript font text ouput the default (output-text "ps")

        Updated page manager to work with gtk+ 1.1.x (scrolled window works
        better, but not 100%)

1/24/99 Added a read/execute guile script option (-s script_filename)

        Added a script file selection dialog box (for executing scripts)

        Added menu option and keymapping for File/Script Execute...

        Added global variable global_window_current, which will be used by
        various guile functions, since they have no idea which window they
        are executing for/in. (careful with multi windows anyway)

        Added command line flag -o (for specifing output an filename)

        Added file g_funcs.c which will hold basic guile functions

        Added gschem-print, gschem-exit, gschem-use-rc-values guile functions

1/23/99 Finally changed where the rc file(s) are read -- before the window
        is created.  This allows for much more flexiablity in the user
        interface

        Found most of the bugs in above (I hope)

        Did some further rearranging in x_window.c so that above works better

        Added "scrollbars" keyword to the rc file, which controls if scrollbars
        are displayed or not (default will be on for now)

        Added "output-orientation" keyword to the rc file, which controls the
        default page orientation (landscape/portrait)

        Added support for portrait postscript printing to the print dialog box

        Changed the radio buttons (for print output type, limits/window) to be
        an options menu instead, much cleaner.  Added some labels

        Fixed a minor bug in above (wrong label being displayed)

        Added "output-color-background" keyword for controlling the
        background color in postcript output (also added supporting code)
        (letter size sheets ONLY)

        Added "output-color" keyword for controlling if postscript is color
        or not

        Added "output-type" keyword which specifies "limits" or
        "current-window"

        Renamed keyword "text-output" to "output-text" just to be consistant
        Might eventually change output to postscript

1/21/98 Added a message to the start of gschem about the warnings when
        using gtk+ 1.1.x

1/12/98 Worked on x_attrsel.c and x_print.c to get them gtk+ 1.1.x
        compliant.

1/10/98        Spent some time working on the scrolled_window changes in
        x_compsel.c for gtk+ 1.1.x, still needs some work though

1/9/98        Started integrating patch for 1.1.x (provided by Egil Kvaleberg)
         (using GTK_DEVEL #define)
                 GtkAcceleratorTable -> GtkAccelGroup (x_menu.c)
                 GtkAcceleratorTable -> GtkAccelGroup (x_window.c)
                gtk_window_add_accelerator_table ->
                  gtk_window_add_accel_group              (x_window.c)

         Added a few #include <math.h> where they were missing (compiler
         warnings for fabs)

1/06/98  Fixed some code in o_erase_* where a constant instead of a variable
         was being used for a color (BLACK -> w_current->background_color),
         pointed out by Anatole Sokolov

1/05/98  Incorperated negative grid point display patch by Mike Jarabek

         Found and fixed (I think) a bug with displaying schematics for
         the first time (after a load), display wasn`t being zoomed limits
         if there where coordinates with negative values (display will not be
         zoomed properly, since negative values are not supported for
         scrollbars)

12/29/98 Changed x_grid_draw to draw to backingstore and then copy that
         to the drawing area, hopefully that`ll speed things up when gschem
         runs over a lan?

         Commented out the above code, need to due some further testing.

12/15/98 Fixed line/pin/net to deal with the real clipping code

         Now all line related objects are being clipped, fixed the
         disappearing lines/nets/pins when zoomed in really close

12/13/98 Integrated Jeff McNeal transparent zoom/pan patch.  It works,
         but it still needs some work, since panning and zooming while
         drawing nets/pins leaves xor droppings

         Added pin-color to gschemrc file.  For some odd reason was missing.

         Also found another bug which was causing the pin color to be saved
         as -1, fixed

         Added File/Save All menu option and hotkey to save all documents
         and not bother asking.

         Added code to o_complex_end to support the concept of an included
         component, which basically is the inclusion of all the pieces of
         a component so they can be edited.  Useful in symbol creation; you
         can reuse other components.

         Changed the add component dialog box to allow for a selection between
         the default, embed and now include ways of adding components.
         I don`t like the way it works, so I`m probably going to go with a
         option menu instead of radio buttons

         Changed the above radio boxes to an option menu, much cleaner looking

         Found a place where I was trying to strcpy into a NULL rc_filename
         doh!

12/10/98 Finished adding the first step for autoconnect to the nearest
         net point

         Added o_conn_search_closest to search inside complex objects for
         the nearest pin

         Added an event_state = STARTDRAWNET to i_callback_add_net_hotkey
         to make the o_net_start connection code work

         Added o_conn_search_closest_range to search for the nearest pin/net
         with range

         Removed the net snapping stuff for now, it still needs a lot of work.

         Added command line argument -r (which specifies an rc file after
         it tries to read all the other standard rc files)

         Finally make rc_filename a pointer instead of statically allocating
         the space

12/9/98 Changed how circles are drawn, specify center point and then the
        radius.  o_circle_start, o_circle_end, o_circle_rubberband
        Includes a line which shows the radius of the circle when you
        rubberband

        Changed the way the width of pins and nets is determined, now using
        the SCREENabs routine when drawing thick pins/nets

        Fixed the way the size of the endpoint/midpoint cues is calculated
        (o_conn_*)

        Minor circle cleanup: made sure radius is multiple of grid snap if
        snap is on; made sure final circle is drawn on backingstore

12/8/98 In order to fix the bugs below, have to rewrite some circle code,
        integrated changes to deal with struct.h changes and libgeda changes
        (o_circle.c)

12/6/98 Found the reason why dist was working all this time.  Another bug
        with adding in a circle, o_circle_end, sending the wrong coord into
        the add function (dumb luck circles ever worked)

11/15/98 Changed the way the print dialog box works, no longer grabs the
         application focus.  You can leave it open and print whenever you
         want

         Changed the size of the visual cues for nets (in o_conn.c)

11/10/98 Changed a label in the print dialog box: "Current Window"

11/8/98        Found a bug when drawing single point lines (ie line as zero length)
        Fixed by adding a (few) call for draw point in o_line_draw,
        not sure that`s the best solution.

        Added zero length error checking code to all primitive objects
        ( interesting side effect, you can end net draw by drawing a
          zero length net and that stops the action )

        Removed some code in o_arc.c which erased the rubberband line
        incorrectly

        You could segfault gschem by inputing a null string (nothing) and
        then hitting apply and drawing over to the drawing area.  Fixed by
        moving x state change code inside the if "check if not null"
        (attribute add is okay)

11/7/98 After applying text input, highlight the selection in the dialog box
        (changed to behave this way)

11/6/98 Added some checks to prevent gschem from core dumping when you hit
        one of the special "microsoft keys"

        Added code to handle the new papersize list

        Added x_print.c (the printing dialog box) and supporting code

        Added paper-sizes keyword to rc file

        Added print_output_type init in i_vars.c

        Called new dialog box from i_callbacks_print

        Added some ... to the Print entry in the pulldown menu

        Got print dialog mostly working

        Added many entries in the *rc files for page-size and page-sizes

11/5/98 Added paper-size to gschemrc file (changes to g_rc, g_register)

10/30/98 Cleaned up (indentation, long lines) a_zoom and i_pan_world code a lot

10/28/98 Rearranged View menu a bit

         Applied patch by Manu for a_zoom_limits

         Had to make minor modifications to make above work on all cases.

10/27/98 Started to add zoom box code (a_zoom_box_*)

         Modified x_events.c and associated files to support above

         Finished off a_zoom_box_start/_end and the actual work function
         a_zoom_box()  I think this works okay, but it`s not perfect.

         Added hotkey zoom-box version and added key to keymaps in the
         *rc files

10/25/98 Cleaned up all warnings

10/24/98 Added slotting update to rotate/mirror code.

         Got keyboard shortcut implemented for the slotting

         Re arranged the edit menu

         Changed a few of the status lines in the copy/move (and hotkey)
         callbacks

10/22/98 Added code in o_read to update the slot if the last read object
         was a component

         Added o_attrib_slot_update in o_copy_end

         Added code to o_copy_end to deal with slotting (ie copy the info
         from the object that is being copied) and the selection list

         Updated o_slot_end to use the new o_attrib_slot_update

         Added o_erase_single, just as a function to make life easier

         Attempted to get the slot= attribute to be update and drawn
         correctly if it is visible.  This does not work right yet.

         Got the first working version of the slotting done

         bug: Old component outline not being erased if you select a new
         component from the list (pointed out by Patrick Bertholon, thanks)

10/20/98 Added Stefan`s and thi`s latest gschem.scm
                - repeat-last-command doesn`t cause a stack overflow
                - bit more paranoid code.
                - last-command-sequence (holds what it says)

          Change rc file guile primitive version to gschem-version

10/18/98 Added callbacks for change Slot... code

         Added o_slot_start which starts the change of a slot number

         Added dialog box for slot editing...

         Added o_slot_end which finished up the slot number change operation

         Split up some of the bigger functions in a_basic.c into o_move.c,
         o_copy.c, o_slot.c, and o_delete.c

         Worked some on o_slot_end, slot attribute value is being changed
         and added if needed as of today, but schematic not reflected.
         (to be finished later..)

10/17/98 misc minor fix to the rc file (text-input "ps")

         Applied patch by Roger which added variable snap spacing.

10/15/98 Increased the size of the component select dialog box

         Display ONLY symbols with the extension .sym, this implies that u
         symbols must end .sym to be displayed

         An attempt fix the arc bound box code of arcs, doesn`t quite
         work 100%.

10/12/98 Added device attribute to the list of default attributes in the rc
         files

         Finally fixed an outstanding bug in the arc drawing/adding etc...
         (this fix might have broken arcs, but so far it looks good)

10/11/98 Added parsecmd.c (command line argument parsing)

         Simplifed the loading of schematic pages and incorperated above

         Added quiet_mode and verbose_mode to the command line arguments
         as well as the usage() function which exits

         Removed all warnings

         Added "graphical" as a default attribute in the rc files

10/9/98 Removed some #if 0 code and did some minor code cleanup

        Fix an asthetic problem (misc pin/net droppings in lower left
        corner when doing mirrors/rotates)

        Added this improved gschem.scm (not fully using all the new stuff
        in there yet)

10/8/98 Worked some more on mirroring of complex objects, almost got it
        completely right except for text inside complex objects

        I got the above fixed (with really ugly kludge) :-( will eventually
        get it totally fixed once I figure out how to flip/rotate text
        in place.

10/6/98 Added code to deal with mirror of complexs (mainly change to
        complex_add)

10/5/98 Added o_mirror (and all required support code, events, i_callbacks...)

        Added *_mirror_hotkeys

        Added g_key *mirror code

10/4/98 Changed default size for a 800x600 sized display

        Added text-output keyword to control how text is rendered

10/1/98 Fixed all warnings

9/29/98 Today starts the new release system: 19980929

        Added code to properly keep attached attributes attached when you
        rotate a component

        Fixed a bug that was causing text to be saved twice (once as an
        attribute and once as a regular text item).

0.0.5
-------
9/27/98 Discovered that selection_tail wasn`t being set to tail in o_select
        Fixed.

        I think I got my kludge for rotating complex objects done.  Need to
        de-kludge it one of these days

        Found a bug in o_complex_end, where the selection tail and the prev
        pointers where not being set

        Fixed the same bug in o_ntext_end

        Found/fixed a really nasty old bug in o_unselect_all where
        selection_tail wasn`t being update at all

        Found/fixed a whole bunch more places where selection_tail
        (in o_select_*) wasn`t being update (ie it was dangling)

        Fixed a bunch of places in the i_callback functions where the middle
        button short cut key wasn`t been set to the hotkey version of the
        function

        Added selection_list code for rotating complex objects (ie once a
        complex is rotated, it stays in the selection list)

        Went back and change Edit/Rotate Primative to Edit/Rotate 90 in
        all applicable locations (x_menus, g_*, gschemrc.in files)

        Added code and a message stating that rotating an embedded component
        isn`t possible yet. (it should be, but I`ll worry about that later)

        Changed default pan behavior when you select it from the hotkey--
        it pan using the current mouse position as the center

        Set zoom_scale to a constant in the code which determines whether we
        are drawing an sbox or just selecting single object

        Found a few more misused selection_tails in o_attrib (tag new ales)

        Go rid of net que droppings being left behind by rotate

        Added needed function call so that nets and pin associations are
        recalculated after a rotate

9/25/98 Worked some more on o_rotate (a_basic)

        Missed a zoom_scale/factor bug dealing with sboxes, you couldn`t
        draw an sbox at high zoom factors.  Now fixed, by removing multipler

        Removed all attempts at getting complex`s rotating... that will
        be handled differently.

        Removed some dead code from i_callbacks.c (old ntext stuff)

        Changed o_rotate to o_rotate_primitives (fixed in all places)

        Changed menu option and rc files edit-rotate to edit-rotate-prim
        Edit/Rotate Primative

        Successfully intergrated rotate ntext into the o_rotate_primitive
        command

9/21/98 Minor gschemrc changes (keymapping fixes)

        Fixed a minor asthetic bug dealing with placing text and seeing a
        ghost image of the newly placed text (erase the bounding/outline box)
        (Migrated change to attribute place as well)

        Fixed a minor bug with the keymapping code, modifiers are no longer
        passed to the guile code

        Made the default select color grey

        Added ENDROTATE define to x_states.h

        Added i_callback_edit_rotate, g_key_edit_rotate and the guile
        register function

        Started changing rotate and "Add *" functions to start their
        actions the moment the hotkey is pressed

        Started adding code and support functions for edit-rotate (not
        finished yet)

        Fixed o_rotate to at least call the various o_*_rotate funcs

9/19/98        Added a few more hot key defs into the rc files

        Added no-action guile function to gschem.scm

        Changed 3rd button cancel for all modes (net/box etc..) so that it
        changes you into select mode

        Changed the way text is placed.  Now it is similar to the way
        attributes are placed (dialog box comes up, type in text, move and
        place text)

9/18/98 Adding code to do the move/copy action change (action
        starts right away after mouse press

        Added edit-move-hotkey and edit-copy-hotkey to take above change
        into account (changed rc files as well)

        Renamed paper-size to world-size to reflect that paper is no longer
        specified in the same fashion

        Fixed the lack of scrollbar updates when you don`t specify a schematic
        to be loaded

9/17/98 Added the modifiers (Alt, Shift, Control) into the string which
        is passed to the guile key lookup routines

        Fixed/Added a few misc items to the keymapping in the rc files

9/13/98        Added some feedback (loading message) if you specify schematics at
        the commandline

        Added scheme-directory keyword (and supporting code) to the rc file

        Disabled all GtkAccelerators in x_menu.c

        Added g_key.c (support functions of guile key mapping support)

        Added all menu callback functions to g_key (as g_key_*)

        Added gh_register functions for above (g_register.c)

        Deleted ifdefd out keymapping code in g_rc.c

        Added gschem.scm file which has scheme code for keymapping

        Added data structures to support scheme keymapping (gschemrc.in)

9/12/98 Added Zoom Limits option (and underlying code)  experimental

        Started preliminary change to make zoom_factor represent the
        magnification, not the zoom number (how many times you zoomed in)

        Changed zoom functions to take above into account

        Changed o_conn functions to use return_zoom_number (in libgeda)
        Also fixed o_pin and o_net thickness

        Changed x_grid to use return_zoom_number -- also new grid spacing
        for the different levels, also experimental

        Changed default page-size to be big, this will change to world-size
        soon.  Made most necessary changes to accomodate this.

        Found a very very serious bug when the above change was made
        (copy/move of objects wouldn`t copy complex vs nets/pins correctly)
        Fixed by making all *_translate -> *_translate_world (in a_basic.c)

        Spent some more time getting size of endpoint cues and friends
        to look right

        Added a a_zoom_limits call when schematics are opened from the command
        line and from the file dialog box

        Added a few experimantal DONT_REDRAW lines to see if I can prevent
        the drawing of schematics and connection points when gschem comes up
        (and when you open schematics)

9/4/98        Added a few more libgeda/prototypes.h in a few missed files

        Moved f_print.c to libgeda

        Moved a few misc routines back and forth between gschem and libgeda

        Renamed some routines to take into account the vectoring of some
        functions in libgeda

        Extensive work here and libgeda to get rid of all prototype related
        warnings

        Playing some games with the o_pin_conn* and o_net_conn* functions
        (and revectoring) to see if I can improve the look of reading in
        of schematics

9/3/98        Major code reoganization with the new libgeda

        Fixed a bug in o_box, where the new recalc routine wasn`t setting
        some local variables (shouldn`t have been using the vars anyways)

        Removed Add/NEW text menu item (old test code)

8/31/98 More bug fixes to the copy attribute change.
                . o_ntext_copy does not handle attributes now, it is handled by
                  who ever called it
                . o_list_copy_to and o_list_copy_all now take a flag which is
                  either NORMAL or SELECTION (we don`t want to do attributes)
                  when we are adding stuff to the selection buffer
                . Text is copied (o_list_* and o_copy_end routines) last to
                  make sure that all the attribute recieving objects exist
                  in the list

        Fixed another attribute which changed color (to red) at the wrong
        time (basically all text was changing color, eventhough it wasn`t
        supposed to) (fixed in o_copy_end)

        Divided the x_create_drawing into the drawing function and a function
        which sets up the events (x_window_setup_draw_events)

        Added a check to make sure a widget wasn`t null in i_set_filename

        Added a check to make sure a widget wasn`t null in x_hscrollbar_update
        and x_vscrollbar_update

        Created x_preview.c, a highly temp file demonstrating the preview
        capabilities (removed from dist for the time being)

8/30/98 Added support for embedded symbols in schematics
                loading / saving / copying

        Added o_embed (embed all object which are selected)

        Added callback for above and menu option "Embed"

        Added o_unembed (unembed all object which are selected)

        Added callback for above and menu option "Unembed"

        Added embed_complex flag to window structure

        Added default_embed_complex to i_vars.c

        Added checkbutton to component place dialog box for embedded
        components

        Added embed-components to gschemrc file

        Robustified the condition if you cannot unembed a component because
        it was not in the path

        Propagated p_text_string[0] = '\0' changes from gnetlist to gschem

        Propagated head node attribs->object change from gnetlist to gschem

        Started to fix attribute copy problem which has existed for a long
        time (ie attributes were not being copied) (this is highly unstable
        I think)

        Fixed a bug related to the above attribs->object change, bug was in
        detach routine, making the original object all red...

        Continued to fix bugs related to attribute copy fix, several
        in o_list_copy_* and in other places, seems to work now, but highly
        experimental

        Changed the way copies are handled.  First all non text items are
        copied and then text items are copied.  This is for the attribute
        copy code, the text copy is the final stage for attribute copies so
        it has to happen last.

        Put code back in that make floating text which was an attribute, but
        no longer the color red.

8/29/98 Added complex_parent pointer to object structure

        Added code to fill above pointer

8/27/98 Made some further improvements to the grid code so it uses less
        memory, but is still faster then drawing one point at a time

8/26/98 Changed the grid from drawing one point at a time to drawing all the
        points with one call (gdk_draw_points)

        Changed the max zoom factor to 8 instead of 4

        Fixed a bug dealing with different paper sizes and the scrollbars
        (max value on the scrollbars was being set incorrectly)

8/9/98        Added page-size keyword to the rc file (lets you specify the size of
        the drawing area)

8/8/98        Removed old OBJ_TEXT primitive (replaced by OBJ_NTEXT)

        Changed OBJ_NTEXT`s key code to T (was E so that it could coexist with
        OBJ_TEXT)

        Fixed a minor bug with symbol translate and the new text.  Basically
        the origin point wasn`t being translated, object were, but not that
        one point

        In the code, changed font def files from .sch to .sym

        You should not symbol translate with the snap off, so put in warnings
        to log and snap is automatically turned on.  Might change this later

8/7/98        Slightly robustified the reading in of font defs, if char isn`t found
        then use something else (only then do you exit)

        Fixed a minor bug where copying an attached attribute didn`t change
        to the detached attribute color

        Fixed a bug in o_list_copy_all (new routine) which was nuking the
        ADDING_SEL (per window variable).  Fixed it by saving contents before
        calling o_list_copy_to

        Fixed a really old bug in o_text_print (and the new routine for
        ntext).  Invisible text was getting printed (oops)!

8/6/98        Fixed stupid core dump related to freeing a already freed string

        Fixed g_rc_font_directory to be implemented correctly

        Changed text_input dialog box to call new o_ntext routines

        Changed text_input read and save to actually work

        Added OBJ_NTEXT support to: o_move_end, o_copy_end, o_delete,
                                    o_save, o_read,  and a whole bunch
                                    of o_complex/attribute routines

        Fixed up o_ntext_translate, o_ntext_xor_draw o_ntext_translate* and
        the rest of the o_ntext routines

        Redirected end of a text edit to called o_ntext_edit_end

        Fixed o_attrib* so that attributes are the right color (ntext attribs)

        Fixed font_set data structure so that each char has a head.  This was
        needed to make attributes happy.

8/5/98        Added rotate core rotate functions back into source code, not working
        yet

        Added o_line_scale_world

        Added o_line_rotate

        Added o_scale, not done yet

        Added o_rotate, not done yet

        Added/worked on core routines for o_ntext

        Integrated/indented new g_read_file from thi (thanks!)

        Added the keyword font-directory which specify where the vector
        font definitions are contained

        Added font_directory string to the WINDOW structure

        Worked on vector text stuff, getting font_set stuff working

        Added o_list_copy_all

        Added code to free up the font set

8/3/98        Changed startup behavior of gschem (it doesn`t set it position to 0,0)
        (basically causes most window managers to prompt for the position)

        Cleaned up o_ntext a bit more

7/26/98 Work continues with a freshly installed Debian GNU/Linux devel box

        Fixed all #include <gh.h> to #include <guile/gh.h>

        Added s_clib_uniq and supporting functions to see if a clib path is
        uniq (if so add it, else don`t)

        Added s_attrib_uniq to make sure attribute names (which are specified
        in the init file are uniq

        Changed search order for components.  Components are now searched for
        backwards (ie the last specifed clib path is searched first)

        Changed search order for source.  Source is now searched for
        backwards (ie the last specifed slib path is searched first)

        Finished getting all gschemrc keywords converted to new guile format

7/25/98 Added g_basic.c which will contain basic guile setup routines

        Added code to start up the guile interpreter (gschem.c)
        guile is now *required*

        Removed all calls to f_rc_parse (old init file)

        Added g_rc.c which holds new guile init file functions

        Started converting all f_rc keywords to g_rc keywords

        Wrote g_rc_parse (basically it is f_rc_parse)
          The order of rcfile reading is now:
             - system-gschemrc
             - ~/.gEDA/gschemrc
             - ./gschemrc
          where latter rc files override previous ones

        Discovered/fixed a bug in o_net.c, net_style wasn`t being used
        (accidentally left to pin_style), hence you would always get
        nets which were the same style as pins.  oops

        Removed f_rc.c and lex.l from existance (file and Makefile).  Flex/Lex
        is no longer required

        Work stopped very abruptly as my machine decided to corrupt /etc
        (Perfect excuse to try out debian :-)

7/22/98        A user trying to build gEDA on HP-UX discovered that I missed an rint
        call (it wasn`t wrappered by the HAS_RINT define).  Fixed it.

7/21/98 Finally fixed arcs so that any start or end angle arcs print
        properly, involved changing how I handled the translate and rotate
        (used to be scale) in the output postscript

        Put back the filename*.sch -> filename*.ps code when you print to
        postscript.  Even fixed it so that it changes the .sch to .ps or
        if there isn`t a .sch extension then just adds it.

7/19/98        Fixed some misc formatting on most case statements (break statement
        now lined up correctly) and some indentation was wrong as well

        When through and added OBJ_NTEXT type

        Stubbed routines for OBJ_NTEXT (in new file o_ntext.c)

0.0.4
-------

7/11/98 Found and squashed a nasty bug dealing with the object clipping code.
        Basically objects that were not visible were not being update (ie
        bounding boxes not being updated) so selections would find fantom
        objects.

        Rearranged some code (bounding box recalc) inside the object draws
        just to be consistent

        Removed the / * PAGE */ tag from almost every file

        Fixed the threshold bug when you are zoomed in really close, now the
        start an sbox or not is based on the zoom scale

        Removed the STARTSBOX state (fixed states.sch appropriately)

        Removed some snap_grids from o_arc.c, these were a hack and I am not
        sure if I broke arcs now.

        Added some s_log_messages in f_parse_rc so you know which rcfiles were
        read

7/10/98 Fixed some minor nits in some comments

        Removed some // accidentally left in

7/6/98        Added x_status.c which implements the status/log window

        Added s_log.c which holds the log file init/write/close routines

        Fixed a few bugs with the logging mechanism

        Added the ability to read the log file from disk when the status
        window is opened

        Added the rc keywords LoggingDestination and Logging to control
        this logging mechanism

        Added a whole bunch of s_log_message calls through the code so that
        the user gets some feedback as to what is happening

7/4/98         Moved around some of the *visible functions to improve "the detect
        if an object is to be drawn" time (determine if, earlier)

        Added ObjectClipping keyword to control the behavior of the new
        object clipping code (on or off)

        Fixed some minor bugs in the *visible functions

7/3/98         Added low level clipping routines in m_basic.c

        Added high level routine to determine if object is visible

        Added code in all relavent o_* files to use above routine (execpt
        o_text, which will be added later)

        Changed default scrollbar update policy to be continuous (vs delayed)

        Added ScrollbarUpdate to control above behavior

        Squashed a few bugs related to above

7/1/98        Fixed a minor bug in selection box, causing selection box to erase
        underlying schematic

        Changed open symbol behavior so that the FIRST page of the schematic
        is left display after all the schematic pages are opened.

        Fixed a minor memory leak dealing with the allocation of page_filename

        Fixed a core dump condition (if there was no gschemrc, untiled_name or
        series_name would be null and doing a strlen of a null doesn`t work.

6/30/98        Fixed the page manager core dump (open schematic, open page manager,
        open another page (page manager now messed up), click on another page)

6/23/98        Integrated patch by Erick Britis Ortiz which fixed the well known
        selection box problems.  Selection boxes could only be drawn in
        one direction; now you can draw them in all directions.
        Extended patch to work with boxes, so those work as well now!
        A similar patch was provided by Jeff McNeal.  Thanks!

6/21/98        Added series_name variable to WINDOW structure.  This variable
        lets you set a series filename, especially useful when adding new
        pages

        Added series_name and untitled_name to WINDOW structure

        Added DefaultSeriesName keyword to gschemrc file

        Added UntitledName keyword to gschemrc file

        Went through and changed all the places where the above two changes
        would affect.

        Slightly changed where defaults are set and where the rc file is read
        when a new window is opened.

6/20/98        Started working on the Source Library code

        Added s_slib.c (source library)

        Added SourceLibrary keyword to the rc file

        Got basic routines in s_slib working

        Wrote s_slib_getbasename which strips extenstions and trailing _#`s
        from the filename

        Started working on s_slib_search which goes out and hunts for all
        the associated source files

        Squashed a nasty stupid bug in the parse filenames startup code
        was doing: strlen(blah+5) instead of strlen(blah)+5  (still not
        completely correct but close enough for now)

        Squashed another nasty bug, which should have been caught by the
        prototype mechanism, but I didn`t update my prototype.h DOH!
        Wrong number of parameters to update_page_manager

6/14/98        Changed the way the CHANGED flag works.  Now you get a single dialog
        box saying that "there are schematics unsaved!".

        You now get one exit dialog for each window instead of the mess of
        multiple exit dialog boxes

        Added back the window grab for exit dialog boxes.

        Removed the SaveAs dialog box when you exit / create a new page /
        open a new schematic

        Modified x_window_close taking in account the above changes

        Modified exit_dialog to be larger and give a more blarring warning
        about unsaved dialog boxes.

        Removed the all tcl support; all of it was experiemental

        Found and squashed a minor memory leak, was allocating a structure
        twice

        Added code to free *all* pages when you exit the program

        Found a minor bug in above code which caused a coredump (w_current->
        page_current wasn`t being reset)

        Added very prelim ability to load up *all* specified schematics
        (which are on the commandline) at startup. (try gschem *.sch in ../bin)

        Found a bug in the calling of s_page_free_all, the last parameter was
        not page_tail (it has to be)

        Added back the code which if you hit Save (not saveas) and the
        filename had an "untitled.sch" in it, you would get a SaveAs dialog
        box

        When you create a new filename the cwd is prepended to it.  (that
        wasn`t the case till I added the code back to do so)

        Started work on the page manager (nothing more than a dialog box
        which makes dealing with all the open pages easier).

        Added update button and current page tracking to the page manager

        Added num_untitled counter to keep track of untitled pages (for
        uniqueness)

6/9/98        Put an #if 0 around TRUE/FALSE defines in defines.h since gtk+ 1.0.4
        defines these in glib.h now.

        Changed page mechanism so that zoom factor and zoom display is included
        in a per page structure

        Fixed a minor bug when drawing arc and the new page mechanism,
        wasn`t setting up the world coord system at the right time (too late)

        Added a check to see if a schematic file exists, if it doesn`t then
        do nothing else load the file.  This was causing a core dump.

        Found a few places where the HAS_TCL wasn`t and hence gschem wouldn`t
        compile (added the HAS_TCL #ifdef).

6/8/98        Did some more testing of the page mechanism.  Still very crude.

        Made it so that open adds a new page, instead of replacing current

6/7/98         Got core page mechanism working.  Still need to verify free routine
        and decided on how to have pages created deleted.

6/6/98        Put scripting stuff on hold, worked on getting multi page stuff done

 - 3 weeks of no significant work :( -

5/18/98 Started experimenting with tcl and gschem, still not convinced this
        is the way to go.  Will look into guile (and swig)

5/17/98        Started adding support for tcl
                Create interp
                Delete interp

        Started adding multi page support
                Added st_page structure
                Added stub s_page routines

5/16/98        Fixed several bugs in cancel callbacks for most dialog boxs; was not
        setting event_state to select mode, but was setting status label to
        Select Mode

0.0.3
-------
5/10/98        Changed MOVE/COPY/PAN modes so that they DO NOT stay in MOVE/COPY/PAN
        Staying after execution of these modes was driving me nuts.

        Fixed a minor cosmetic bug in the saveas dialog box (wasn`t updating
        the filename at the bottom of the screen)

        Fixed a nasty (been there since v0.0.1) with the creation of selection
        lists in o_move_end and o_copy_end.  prev link wasn`t being set, which
        caused a segfault in o_attrib_get_name_value

        Found another bug in change_basename (x_compsel.c) which has a holdout
        from pre-multiwindow days (caused a coredump).  An incorrect pointer
        was being passed to the apply button callback (should be w_current).

5/9/98         Quit now checks the CHANGED flag properly and prompts you to save.
        Still some weirdness with multi window quit and dialog boxes

        Went through the code and changed the interface code so that you
        stay in a mode unless you change modes (there are exceptions to this)

        Added some error condition functions (in call callback and event
        functions)

        Re-enabled the window grab on the text edit dialog box.  This might
        stay this way for a while.

        Fixed a minor bug in x_window_close_all, so that you didn`t free
        the window_head node unless next was empty

        Fixed the names of menu items (New/Close Window etc...)

5/7/98        Worked a bit more on the multi window code, getting it solid

        Added a head node to window_head just to make my life easier
        ( head nodes aren`t deallocated and so window_head doesn`t change)

        Fixed a nasty bug with the text size dialog box.  Had a variable
        entry which wasn`t inited or used, but was being referenced!

        Fixed another holdover bug (from the days when null entry input
        caused gtk to coredump) in the text size dialog box

5/6/98  Fixed a few memory leaks, there are still a few, but those are in
        gtk/my code that doesn`t deallocate resources which gtk provides

5/3/98         Fixed a minor bug dealing with not having a default for
        override_net|pin_color, which caused problems when gschem
        could not find a gschemrc file.

        Fixed a minor bug dealing with sending delete events to a window,
        data parameter wasn`t being passed.  (disabled both delete and
        destroy for now)

5/2/98  Finished global cleanup, gschem now builds cleanly, and seems to
        run and seems to be stable.  *All* functionality needs to be checked

        Added New window menu item

5/1/98  Continued work on global cleanup

4/29/98 Started final cleanup to remove all globals.  This involves passing
        WINDOW * to all function that require the contained variables.

        Got rid of i_vars.h file, moved contents into defines.h

4/26/98 Worked some more on new WINDOW structure (MAJOR code CHANGE)

        Got program to compile, works mostly, not completely stable yet.

4/25/98 Further reduced the number of globals in x_dialog.c

        Created the new WINDOW structure and started changing every file
        to use this new structure (MAJOR code CHANGE)

4/24/98 Typedefed st_objects, st_attrib, and st_linepts (major code change)

        Began process of figuring out which variables are getting encapsulated
        in the "per-window" and "pages" structures

4/23/98 Whole bunch of code cleanup, including making most variables consistant
        renaming a few functions.

4/20/98        Fixed Makefile.am to not include the math library (-lm) twice

0.0.2
-------
4/16/98 Tested code with GTK+ 1.0.0.  This will be the version of gtk which
        will work with gschem.

        Changed the order of init functions in main.c

        Fixed two nasty bugs that deal with the Add Attribute code
        1) wasn`t properly checking for no input in the name/value boxes
        2) wasn`t allocating enough memory for current_attribute.

4/15/98 Added some finishing touches to the Add Attribute dialog box and
        the code that actually does the work.

        Removed accelerator keys from popup menu.  They were misbehaving
        (sometimes the accelerator key would be reassigned a new one???)
        and this way the right mouse button popup will be smaller.

4/14/98 Worked some more on the Add Attribute dialog box

        Added AttributeName keyword to the rc file(s).  This keyword adds
        the names to the Add/Attribute dialog box.

        Started putting in the underlying code that is called by the various
        Add Attribute buttons.

        Added some low level functions to o_attrib.c to support above activity

        Changed Arc hotkey to Shift-R and added Add/Attribute as "a"

4/12/98 Added the #ifdefs to things that configure checks for (some of them)

        Disabled the very broken "get correct filename.ps" code when you
         print something.  Right now all postscript output goes to out.ps

        Fixed a minor bug: if you are drawing a net and haven`t yet placed
          the first point and then you hit the right button a redraw is not
        needed.  (removed the redraw)

        Started to add : Add/Attribute dialog box and mechanism(s)

4/11/98 Fixed up most compiler warnings about missing prototypes and unused
        variables

        Tested code with gtk version 0.99.10
                Due to changes in this version, several changes had to occur:
                        Now forcing a update of scrollbars when you startup
                        Fixed dialog boxes when users enters null string

        Added scrollbar updates to open and new callback routines

        Fixed text enter, text edit, text size, translate, arc angles dialog
        boxes so that enter is equivalent to clicking OK.

        Added the ability to draw non-orthogonal nets if you press the CONTROL
        key as you are drawing the nets.  Normally you would want to draw nets
        which are orthogonal but there are exceptions to this.  NOTE: if you
        draw an non-ortho net then you cannot connect to it in the middle; you
        can only connect to it at the ends. (need to document this)

        As a result of above, a bug was found in the connection search routine.
        The fix is highly experimental so if any midpoint nets which should
        be connected are not, then e-mail the maintainers.

        Likewise added the ability to draw ortho lines by pressing the CONTROL
        key as you draw the line.   Lines are normally non-ortho, but sometimes
        it`s nice to draw a prefectly straight line without being coordinated.
        (need to document this)

4/10/98 Added underlying code to implement the scrollbars

        Minor changes (asthetic code changes) to drawing window size

4/9/98  Added TextCapsStyle rcfile keyword

        Totally rewrote o_text to allow text to be any point size

        Added some code to put a few pixels inbetween each text character
        (right now turned off)

        Added text size selection dialog

        Changed Version keyword in rcfile to reflect new version (0.0.2)

        Changed default text size to be 10 point

        Removed the code that controlled (limited) text size in rcfiles

        Fixed most dialog box titles

        Fixed all example .sch files to have 10 point text labels

        Fixed postscript printing to deal with new text size system

4/7/98        Fixed minor bug with opening a file and CHANGED flag not being cleared

4/6/98        Relaxed aspectratio calculation (no more aspectratio enforcement)

        Changed default drawing area min size to 800x600

        Merged m_prims.c and m_matrix.c into m_basic.c (new file)

        Added a pixmap unref to i_callback_file_quit()

        Added call to hide file ops in all file selection dialog boxes

        Fixed searching order of rc files

        Added scroll bars to right and bottom.  Underlying code not impl.
