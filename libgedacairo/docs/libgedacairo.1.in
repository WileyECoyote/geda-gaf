.SH NAME
.PP
Libgedacairo \- Cairo-based Schematic and Symbol Renderer Library
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B Libgedacairo
library provides a renderer for schematics and symbols based on the Cairo
vector graphics library and the Pango font library. Data for rendering is
loaded using libgeda.

The library does *not* provide a rendering widget for programs, although
.B Libgedacairo
could be used to implement one. The library is intended for more general
rendering usage, e.g. to screen, to printers, or to various image formats.
.LP
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
Library operations are controlled by programmatically setting properties
of the EdaRenderer object, see below for more information. For details on
setting up linkage see
\fBlibgedacairo\fR(3)
.LP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.B Libgedacairo
does not recognize any environment variables. Operations are controlled by
programmatically setting properties of the EdaRenderer object. The Cairo
library does recognize a limited number of environment variables
:
.LP
.TP 8
.SS CAIRO_GL_COMPOSITOR
.LP
.TP 8
.SS CAIRO_GALLIUM_LIBDIR
.LP
.TP 8
.SS CAIRO_GALLIUM_FORCE
.LP
See the Cairo library documentation for information on the use of these
environment variables.

.SH USAGE
.PP
.TP 8
.SS COORDINATE SYSTEMS
An important concept to understand when using an EdaRenderer is the distinction
between Cairo's "device coordinates" and "user coordinates". (Yes, go and look it up now).
.IP
Before calling any
.B Libgedacairo
drawing functions, the Cairo context's transformation matrix must be set so
that user coordinates match coordinates on the schematic or symbol page.
.PP
.TP 8
.SS EDARENDERER CLASS
The EdaRenderer class is the main interface to the library. The EdaRenderer
class uses information from libgeda OBJECT structures to draw various schematic
elements, control grips, and cues.
.IP
An EdaRenderer is a GObject with the following properties that control
behaviour:
.IP
  "cairo-context"  [pointer]
      The Cairo drawing context which the renderer draws to.
.IP
  "pango-context"  [pointer]
      The state of the Pango string-to-glyph itemizer. The renderer
      will automatically create one from the drawing context if not
      explicitly set.
.IP
  "font-name"  [string]
      The font to use when drawing text.  By default, this is "Arial".
.IP
  "color-map"  [pointer]
      A GArray of libgeda "COLOR" structures which is used as the
      color map for drawing. Note that the EdaRenderer does not make
      a copy of this array, and doesn't free it when the EdaRenderer
      is destroyed.
.IP
  "override-color"  [int]
      Index of a color to force all drawing to take place with. This
      can be used e.g. when highlighting a set of objects in a particular
      color. If "override-color" is set to -1, color override is disabled.
.IP
  "junction-color"  [GDK_TYPE_COLOR]
      GDK color to use when rendering Junctions.
.IP
  "junction-size"  [interger]
      Size to draw junction cue points.
.IP
  "net-endpoint-color"  [GDK_TYPE_COLOR]
      GDK color to use when rendering Net and Pin endpoints.
.IP
  "text-marker-color"  [GDK_TYPE_COLOR]
      GDK color to use when rendering text markers.
.IP
  "text-marker-size"  [interger]
      Size to draw text markers.
.IP
  "text-marker-threshold"  [double]
      The threshold to draw text markers.
.IP
  "draw-grip"  [Boolean]
      Controls if grips should be drawn.
.IP
  "grip-size"  [double]
      Size to draw grips, in *user* coordinates.
.IP
  "grips-stroke"  [GDK_TYPE_COLOR]
      GDK color to use when rendering strokes for grips.
.IP
  "grips-fill"  [GDK_TYPE_COLOR]
      GDK color to use when rendering background of grips.
.IP
  "circle-grip-quadrant"  [GDK_TYPE_COLOR]
      Controls where grips are drawn on circles.
.IP
  "render-flags"  [EdaRendererFlags]
      Flags that control various rendering options.
.IP
A EdaRendererFlags value can include any of these flags:
.IP
  EDA_RENDERER_FLAG_HINTING
      Enable line hinting. Set this flag when rendering to a screen
      or raster image file, because it makes things look prettier.
  EDA_RENDERER_FLAG_PICTURE_OUTLINE
      Draw only the outlines of pictures, and not their contents.
  EDA_RENDERER_FLAG_TEXT_HIDDEN
      Draw text even if it is set to be invisible.
  EDA_RENDERER_FLAG_TEXT_OUTLINE
      Draw only the outlines of text objects.
  EDA_RENDERER_FLAG_TEXT_ORIGIN
      Draw small "X" markers indicating where text objects are
      anchored.
.IP
To actually draw shapes or objects, EdaRenderer has three methods:
.IP
  eda_renderer_draw()
      This does basic drawing of an OBJECT.

  eda_renderer_draw_grips()
      Draw grips at all of the control points of an OBJECT.

  eda_renderer_draw_cues()
      Draw cues for an object (e.g. at the unconnected ends of pins and
      nets, and at junctions in nets and buses).
.IP
Sometimes, it is useful to obtain the rendered bounding box of an OBJECT
(for example, a text OBJECT's bounding box is determined by the font).
.IP
  eda_renderer_get_user_bounds()
      Obtain the user bounds (which should be the same as world
      bounds) for an OBJECT.
.IP
These methods all can be overridden from subclasses.

.SH DOCUMENTATION
.PP
.TP 8
.SS SOURCE CODE
The gEDA-gaf suite utilizes Doxygen for generating source documentation. By
default this documentation is not generated and must be enabled via the
configuration option --with-doxygen. When enabled, the documentation is then
built in the source tree using "make doxygen" from the top of the source. To
only generate source documentation for
.B Libgedacairo
use "make doxygen" from within the top libgeda directory. Note that the
configure script can also set the configuration to allows generating the source
documentation out of the source tree using the --with-doxygen-out option. For
example using --with-doxygen-out=/tmp/geda-gaf will cause the resulting
documentation to be generated in the "/tmp/geda-gaf" directory. The target
directory will created if it does not already exist. It is not necessary to use
both doxygen options, using --with-doxygen-out automatically enables --with-doxygen.
The Doxygen configuration is set to produce both HTML and latex. Other formats
are possible, see the Doxygen documentation for details.
