 * \brief Define ANSI Constants
 * \par
 *  This file defines constants used in ANSI escape sequences, which can
 *  be used to add color and other attributes to output data for terminals.
 *
 *  Example:
 *
 *     printf("%sred%s\n", FG_RED, RESET);
 *
 *     or better:
 *
 *     printf("The quick " FG_RED "red" RESET " fox jumped over the " FG_YELLOW "yellow" RESET " dog\n");
