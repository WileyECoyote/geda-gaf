Gattrib todos.

Last updated 08.30.2018 -- WEH

*  Column context menu, and maybe main menu, should have an option to auto set
   the width of columns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a running list of things left to be done with gattrib.  Items
already completed are marked with  #####. 

*  #####  Fix key_press event handling so that arrow keys work intelligently
   when using gtk-2.2. WEH:Done 10/28/12.

*  Decide what to do about "pins" editing:  How to save out chages?
   Right now "pins" are only displayed, they cannot be changed.

*  #####  Add "component pins" page to allow users to edit component pin attributes.
   This is useful to make sure that the pin attributess are correctly 
   set for use with PCB & other layout packages.

*  #####  Create separate comp_attrib and net_attrib variables.

*  #####  Handle saving out of multi-page design so that it correctly saves
   individual pages back to their destination (i.e. page1.sch ->
   page1.sch, page2.sch -> page2.sch.)  Currently smashes all pages
   together.

*  Find out why it leaves "xterm" on the command prompt when you
   invoke the prog with no files on the cmd line.  This may be GTK bug.
   WEH: Could not recreate this 10/28/12.

*  Change save menus to:  save project, save as, which cycles through
   pages and saves objects out on a page by page basis.

*  Incorporate a "close" item on the menu to close out the current
   project without quitting the whole application.

*  flesh out net handling functions.  Need to more fully understand
   how nets work.  Note that they must be read in differently from
   components -- you need to read the whole project in before handling
   nets because each net segment is separate, but the net itself can span
   many components and pages.

*  Add info about NETS and net attribs into NOTES.

*  #####  Go over OBJECT struct data in NOTES -- is (ATTRIB attached_to)
   info correct?

*  ##### Implement sort of master lists.

*  Install text_entry widget below menu & above spreadsheet (like in Excel).
   Use this widget for text entry into cell, like in Excel.

*  #####  Fix problem where pages read at different times are not merged.

*  #####  re-write NOTES and documentation for project.

*  #####  Include gnumeric spreadsheet into DIST_EXTRA

*  make sure comments in each fcn are true

*  #####  Make sure all DEBUG printfs are accurate & give the correct fcn name.

*  Re-introduce I18N stuff where I took it out.

*  ##### clean out i_basic.c -- there are too many "if 0" regions in there.

*  ##### Change attrib update algorithm to write out both old, updated
   attribs as well as new ones for each component.

*  #####  Fix segfault when run on OpticalReceiver without valgrind or
   GDB.  (Fix: free in wrong place was moved to correct place in
   gattrib.c)

*  Eventually re-introduce hierarchy. Important for nets.

*  Add in fcns dealing with nets spanning pages.

*  #####  Incorporate Dan's changes, including Makefile changes, warning
   stuff, and make sure prog doesn't segfault if no attributes are
   found.

*  #####  gattribrc should be installed in RC dir as part of "make install".
*  #####  Enable horizontal resizing of window.  Currently can't shrink window
   to less than initial width.

*  Fix cells so that a long attrib string doesn't bleed into/overwrite 
   adjacent cells.  Maybe automatically size cell to fit text?  Problem is that
   "file" attributes can be very long.

*  ##### Per Ales, use the gtksheet stuff as a library instead of a bunch of
   source files.  Is this necessary?  No.  I don't want to do this since a
   third-party library can change, which makes support a PITA. WEH:Comment:
   Has been converted to a library for linking but not third-party. (Maybe
   this is at least a compromise, or maybe this is what Ales had in mind,
   dunno, still got source files, but segragated. 10/28/12.)

*  ##### User should be able to set attrib visibility. How to implement &
   show? WEH:Done 11/21/12.

*  #####  Incorporate ability to add attrib columns. WEH:Done 11/13/12.

*  Refactor code so that it makes more sense architecturally.

*  Fix behavior when using arrow keys to be more "MS Excel-like".  Current
   Behavior is a PITA. WEH: Isn't this a repeat of #1? if so: Done 10/28/12.

*  Replicate attrib visibility code from comp attributes to net and pin
   attributes.

*  Change display of attrib text in each cell depending upon attrib
   visibility state.  Example:  Invisible = light grey.  Name only = red.
   Value only = normal. Name & value = bold face.

*  Make gattrib import csv. (WEH: Now that would be way cool, 10/28/12)
