2013-07-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/gtksheet/gtksheetwidget.c: In function: gtk_sheet_get_property()
        changed variable <valarray> from GValueArray to GArray, replaced
        g_value_array_new with g_array_sized_new, g_value_array_append with
        g_array_append_vals, and g_value_array_free with g_array_unref because
        the compiler said these functions were depreciated.
        In function gtk_sheet_class_init(), changed G_TYPE_VALUE_ARRAY to
        G_TYPE_ARRAY for the same reason.

2013-05-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/Makefile.am: Change -I$(abs_top_builddir)/include to
        -I$(top_srcddir)/include. Don't know where i got abs_top_build.

2013-03-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/s_object.c: Changed return type for function s_object_attrib

        default case

2012-12-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * Code Cleanup & Documentation Updates:

      * src/x_window: Eliminated num_rows and num_cols variable in
          function x_window_add_items, these were unnecessary and did not
          appreciably improve readability.
          Added Callback function on_notebook_switch_page for notebook

        * src/x_menu.c: Added new functions x_menus_set_sensitivities and
          x_menu_get_collections to support enabling and disabling menu
          options based on the active notebook sheet.

        * src/x_toolbars.c: Revised x_toolbars_init and added new function
          x_toolbar_set_sensitivities to support enabling and disabling
          toolbar buttons based on the active notebook sheet.

2012-11-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/s_table.c: Major re-vamp, tables are now referecne as [X][Y].
        Revised functions s_table_new,s_table_destroy, s_table_create_attrib
        _pair, s_table_add_items_to_comp_table, s_table_gtksheet_to_table,
        Replaced function s_table_resize with s_table_add
        Added function s_table_remove_attribute

        * src/x_menu.c: Completed implementation of delete attribute
        functionality that was part of the previous commit but was disabled
        in the menus.

        * src/s_toplevel.c: Eliminated s_sheet_data_gtksheet_to_sheetdata,
        this function just called s_table_gtksheet_to_all_tables so now
        s_toplevel_gtksheet_to_toplevel function calls s_table_gtksheet_to
        _all_tables directly.

        * The revisions above fix gattrib's Y-X dilema: Accessing table data
        with X-Y may seem awkward since gtksheet is (backwards) Y-X, but now
        memory can be, and is, allocated and released on a per attribute
        basis, meaning attributes can be freely added or deleted. gattrib can
        not add or remove components so there is no need to manipulate memory
        in terms of rows (Ys).

        * src/x_toolbars.c: Added demote to Attribute toolbar.

2012-11-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/gattrib.c: Revised/Rearranged mainline code so that gattrib
        could startup without a file. The auto-launching file open is what
        user saw first when starting from within GUI OS and that was okay
        but when there was an error in the data gattrib would abort execution,
        not just loading. This was a problem now that gattrib can "open" files
        without restarting. We can not just abort with a message and disappear
        either to a prompt or the desktop, (especially after editing on a file
        and then saving and then disappear after attempting to open a new file.
        Is way not cool!) We could some how restore the old data that was just
        destroyed or present a blank sheet. This commit is devoted to resolving
        this dilemma.

        * src/s_attrib.c: Performed code clean up in function s_attrib_get_refdes.

        * s_properties.c: Renamed file s_visibility to s_properties.c revised
        functions to consolidate code. Eliminated unnecessary header inclusions,
        added functions s_properties_get_current_table, s_properties_get_fgcolor
        _index, s_properties_get_visibility, s_properties_get_show_name_value,
        s_properties_set_cell_fgcolor and s_properties_set_visible. Divided
        s_properties_set_cell into s_properties_set_cell_visibility and
        s_properties_set_cell_show_name. Added s_properties_promote_attribute
        s_properties_demote_attribute

        * src/s_table.c: Renamed s_table_add_toplevel_xxxx_items_to_comp_table
        functions s_table_add_items_to_xxxx_table. Separated conditionals
        (row == -1) || (col == -1) so that the error messages would indicate
        which of the two is actually being reported as an error. Eliminated
        double allocation of temp_uref and changed o_current->atribs to
        o_attrib_return_attribs so list would include inherited attributes.
        Added functionality for inherited attributes.

        * src/x_fileselect: Fixed return value from x_fileselect_load_files.

        * src/x_gtksheet.c: Revised x_gtksheet_add_cell_item function to use
        the new s_properties_get_cell_fgcolor_index function.

        * src/x_menu.c: Added view-inherited-attribs and visibility-visible.
        Note that previously gattrib did not have capability turn on just the
        invisibility flag. Added promote and demote.

      * src/x_window: new function x_window_finalize_startup

2012-11-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/gattrib_dialog.c: Add new compilation unit, this is mostly
        a copy of the gschem version but tweeked for gattrib, i.e. no
        w_current. This is mainly so that Dialog positions could be
        and recalled. gattrib now creates and maintaines a
        retained a ~/gEDA/gattrib-dialog-geometry file.

        * include/gattrib_dialog.h: Added header to support corresponding
        source file.

        * src/g_strings.c: New file for generic string functions. These
        are mostly strings function missing from glibc, maybe should be
        in libgeda but don't want to prefix with u_basic. These were
        developed as internal function to support Sear and Replace but
        are being move to a new file to reduce clutter and so that the
        algorithms can be used in overhaul of Find dialog.

        * src/g_util.c New file for generic utility functions with two
        initial functions: g_list_str_inlist and g_list_stri_inlist. Did
        not find in library and these did not seem to fit in to any of
        the existing files (maybe g_strings.c but thinking other g_list
        oriented functions be required in the future).

        * include/struct.h: Added new structure, st_search, to support
        new Search and Replace functions.

        * src/x_toolbars.c: Added new Attribute toolbar.

        * src/x_dialog.c: Added Search and Replace Dialog, eliminated
        x_dialog_find_value (taht I jst added last week) and modified
        Search and Replace Dialog for Find-Only-Mode.
        Removed create_pixmap function since there is a version in the
        gattrib_dialog.c src that is being added.
        Implemented Search and Replace history.

        * src/x_gtksheet.c: Added functions x_gtksheet_range_copy
        and x_gtksheet_set_max_range to facilitate manipulation
        of range structures. Added gtk_sheet_set_clip_text(sheets[i], TRUE);
        in x_gtksheet_init function. This keeps the text from running over
        into adjacent cells. (Note: There seems to be some confusion
        in GTKSheet regarding the terminology for "clip", in most context it
        is associated with "cut/copy/paste" as in clipboard. There is no
        documentation for the gtk_sheet_set_clip_text function but it has
        nothing to do with "clipboard", it sets a sheet-level property to
        clip rendering at the cell borders.
        Disabled visability of the "Nets" tab. Previously the was controled
        with preprocessor directives to prevent compilation. The Nets tab
        is now compiled in but it is kept off and requires development.
        (TODO: Would it be easer to just have gnetlist generate a text file
        and read that in to the net sheet then to sort through toplevel
        with library?)

      * src/x_window: replace gtk_widget_show_all with gtk_widget_show
        for main window, (requiring that gtk_widget_show be added for the
        main_vbox widget. Also added gtk_window_position with position set
        to GTK_WIN_POS_MOUSE so the main window did open in the top left
        corner of the screen ever time the program starts. Added code to
        support the new Attribute toolbar.

2012-11-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/x_window: Add function x_window_update_title and
      implemented. The new function adds the filename to the
      titlebar and prefixes an asterisk to indicate content
      has changed.

      * src/x_find.c: Created new file to implement search
      features.

      * src/x_dialog: Added functions x_dialog_get_search_text,
        find_text_dialog_response, x_dialog_find_value

        * src/x_menu.c: Enabled menu option for searching and
        replacing that were previously disabled/unimplemented.

        * src/x_toolbars.c: Created new file for toolbar, moving
        the recently add code for toolbars from w_window.c to this
        file.

      * src/x_window: See previous entry for toolbars.

2012-11-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * gattrib: Extension revisions throught-out code adding
        functionality for toolbars, menus. Major changes were as
        follows:
        * src/x_gtksheet.c: Added local function CreateSheet for
        x_gtksheet_init, added argument PageDataSet. Created new
        functions; x_gtksheet_reinititialize to resize the gtksheets
        after new file is loaded. Added signal handlers, starting
        from code in testgtksheet.c and then functional parts were
        revised for use with gattrib. Added auto column width adjustment
        upt to fix size limit defined by COLUMN_WIDTH_LIMIT, set to 200
        for now. This allows auto expansion during loading sheet, to
        a width of about 14 characters. This is done in the function
        x_gtksheet_add_cell_item.

        * src/x_menu.c: New source file, relocated menu code from
        x_window.c and supplemented with new menu handlers. Added
        toolbar toggles and recent file open code (This was hard because
        even after 7 years there does not seem to be an example of
        ui manager with xml and recent manager with chooser! Ultimately
        the solution was to remove the container and replace with
        a new recent manager after GTK was done making uncontrollable
        assumptions, see x_menu_fix_gtk_recent_submenu.)

      * src/x_fileselect.c: Revised x_fileselect_load_files to
        use new function x_fileselect_load_file relocated common code
        to other functions for use by x_menu_file_open and menu_open_recent.

        * src/gattrib: Add calls to functions with code relocated from
        x_fileselect_load_files rather than being executed in the loader,
        added calls to s_toplevel_init_data_set and x_gtksheet_init.

        * src/s_sheet_data: Added function s_sheet_data_reset

      * src/s_table.c: Relocated code from to x_fileselect_load_files
        x_fileselect_load_files function s_table_load_new_page so that
        this code could be called from x_menu_file_open and menu_open_recent.

      * src/x_window: Extensive revision to function x_window_init,
        relocated menu code to x_menu.c. Added x_window_set_title function.

      * lib/gattrib-menus.xml: Update to reflect new menu options.
      * include: Add subfolder gtksheet and move gtksheet headers to
        subfolder, except gtksheet.h so as to better organize code source.

      * include/Makefile.am: Revised for seperation of gtksheet headers
        into subfolder.

2012-10-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/x_gtksheet.c: Replaced #defines with enumerated ColorId
        for function x_gtksheet_add_cell_item, and revised
        x_gtksheet_set_cell_fgcolor to allow limited autoresize
        functionality. Revised x_gtksheet_set_cell_fgcolor.

        * include/globals.h: Added enumerated types ColorId and SheetId.

        *src/gtksheet: Setup subfolder for gtksheet source files and
        created a new makefile.am to generate a temporary gtksheet
        library to link with gattrib. This will allow for better code
        organization and facilitate maintenance. Upgraded gtksheet,
        repaired editing arrow key functionality.

        *src/gtksheet: Upgraded gtksheet module again, this time
        repairing a Pango error that occurred while editing a cell
        when <ctrl-shift-arrow-right> was pressed with the cursor at
        the extreme right of the text. Applied local fixes: moved
        #defines from .c to header and added preprocessor conditionals
        for the gtk_entry_reset_im_context (yet again).
        Revised function x_gtksheet_add_col_labels to adjust the column
        width while adding column labels because sometimes the column
        headings were wider than the widest data field.
        Added Edit Entry widget and revised Location widget.
        Added callbacks for cell editing, and monitoring of changes.
        The codes now sets a flag when any data is modified, thus
        warning the user to save changes on exit, (the warning started
        appearing once the flag was updated, I did not do this part.)

        *src/s_string_list.c: General file cleaning (needs more!).
        *src//s_attrib.c: General code cleaning, added conditional
        to check for slot_value=0, to stop s_attrib_get_refdes from
        appending a period on the end of unslotted components.

        * src/x_fileselect.c: Added new function x_fileselect as a
        generic GTK file chooser.

        * src/x_window.c: Implemented "Save As" functinality.

        * src/s_table.c: Eliminated "we didn't find the row name"
        message in function s_table_create_attrib_pair because the
        messgage was annoying. Added conditionals in functions:
        s_table_add_toplevel_pin_items_to_pin_table
        s_table_add_toplevel_comp_items_to_comp_table
        so components with refdes with type "none" and "pinlabel"
        would not be added to the tables.

        * src/s_sheet_data: Added conditional check for components
        with refdes of type "none" and "pinlabel" in functions:
        s_sheet_data_add_master_comp_list_items
        s_sheet_data_add_master_pin_list_items

        * src/x_dialog.c: Copied generic confirmation dialog from
        gschem and added to gattrib.

        * src/s_toplevel.c: Added s_toplevel_close function.
        Added conditional check for components with refdes of type
        "none" and "pinlabel" in functional:
        s_toplevel_sheetdata_to_toplevel

2012-10-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/*.c: Consolidated Gattrib specific includes into a single
        headers file: gattrib.h

2007-05-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20070526 in prep for the next
        release.

2007-04-28 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

      * include/gettext.h, include/globals.h, include/Makefile.am,
      src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c: Removed gettext.h header file
      and the few _( ) pairs to get rid of some warnings.  gattrib is
      not i18n and should not be using gettext.h for now.

      * src/s_toplevel.c: Removed some unused variable compiler warnings.

2007-04-21 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

      * src/x_dialog.c: Check return value of gdk_keyval_name() is non
        NULL before attempting to match against it. Fixes bug #1692634.

2007-4-21  Stuart Brorson <sdb (AT) cloud9 (DOT) net>
      * src/x_window.c: Modify gattrib so it checks for design changes
      before quitting if user hits delete button on window.  Closes bug
      1704938 from Peter Brett.

2007-04-21 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves (AT) iespana (DOT) es>

      * src/x_fileselect.c:
       - Set the alternative button order for gtk dialogs
         (now with correct responses).
       - Reverted the changes below.
         gtk_dialog_set_alternative_button_order should have the same
         responses as the dialogs.
       - Set the alternative button order for gtk dialogs.
        This would allow to display the correct button order whatever
        system is running this app. Fix for bug #1553483.

2007-04-17 21:16  Dan McMahill <danmc>

      * src/gattrib.c: remove /* within comment

      * src/gtkitementry_2_2.c: Fixed code left accidentally when removing
      an obsolete #if 0'd out section.

2007-4-15  Stuart Brorson <sdb (AT) cloud9 (DOT) net>
      * src/*.c:  Added DOxygen style comment pragma to many (but not all)
      source files.  DOxygenating gattrib is an ongoing project.

2007-04-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

      * src/s_string_list.c: Added missing test to prevent a seg fault
      when loading up a schematic with missing attributes.

2007-4-15  Stuart Brorson <sdb (AT) cloud9 (DOT) net>
      * Makefile.am, configure.ac, docs/*: Created new docs
      directory, and set up framework to create doxygen generated
      docs.

2007-4-3  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
      * src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c:
      Temp fix for bug 1692431 -- don't put net= attribute into
      component attrib table.

2007-2-11 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
      * src/s_toplevel.c: Fixed bug I introduced at code sprint.

      * src/listsort.c, src/s_string_list.c: Applied patch by DJ:
      [ 1637387 ] Enhance sort functions.  Thanks.

      * gattrib/src/globals.c, gattrib/src/i_basic.c,
      gattrib/src/s_toplevel.c, gattrib/src/s_visibility.c,
      gattrib/src/x_gtksheet.c, gattrib/src/x_window.c: Fixed a few
      compiler warnings.  Removed quit_func since it is completely
      unused.

      * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20070216.

2006-12-23 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

      * src/s_object.c (s_object_attrib_add_attrib_in_object):
        Make o_selection_add call match the new selection interface.
        The first argument should be a pointer to the selection list.
        Thanks to Dan McMahill for reporting this.

2006-11-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Fixed libgeda detection/find error message when
        the wrong libgeda version is found. (Bug reported by Karel Kulhavy;
        thanks)

2006-10-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

      column so user is prompted when quitting before saving.

2006-09-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

      * configure.ac : Applied patch #1564796 by Cesar Strauss,
      enabling Cygwin's compilation. Thanks.

2006-09-23  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

      * src/gattrib.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Adapted for new file selection
      dialog.

      * src/x_fileselect.c: Rewrite of the file selection dialog with a
      GtkFileChooser as in gschem.

2006-09-15 Stuart Brorson   <sdb (AT) cloud9 (DOT) net>
      * include/prototype.h, src/g_register.c, src/gattrib.c,
      src/x_dialog.c, src/x_gtksheet.c, src/x_window.c:
      Made gattrib throw up GUI window warning user of no
      components or attributes per request of Peter Clifton.
      Then program exits with non-zero return code.

2006-09-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated program version to 20060906.

      * src/g_rc.c, src/gattrib.c src/x_dialog.c: Added CUSTOM_VERSION to
      all printfs/output/dialog boxes where VERSION is used so that it is
      easier to create custom version of gEDA/gaf.

2006-08-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated gtk+ tests to look for 2.4.x or greater.

2006-08-21   SDB <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * include/prototype.h, src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Fixed
      bug in which adding a new attrib column would munge the
      visibility of existing attributes.

2006-08-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * README: Updated the README a little to be ready for the next
        release.

2006-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version number to 20060821 in prep for the
        next gEDA/gaf release.

2006-08-12  SDB <sdb@cloud9.net>
      * include/prototype.h, src/s_misc.c, src/s_sheet_data.c,
      src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c:  Applied patch from Jeff Mallatt
      which implements ability to handle attrib strings with multiple
      = signs.

2006-08-12  SDB <sdb@cloud9.net>
      * configure.ac, src/parsecmd.c:  Implemented getopt_long
      for systems which have it.

2006-08-12  SDB <sdb@cloud9.net>
      * include/prototype.h, include/x_menu.h,
      src/s_visibility.c, src/x_fileselect.c, src/x_gtksheet.c,
      src/x_window.c:  Made cell text different colors depending
      upon attribute visibility.

2006-08-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/*.c: Applied Patch#1533798: Remove pre-GTK2 code from geda
        by Peter Brett.

2006-07-31 SDB <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * src/gtksheet_2_2.c: fixed bug in gtk_sheet_make_backing_pixmap.

2006-07-25 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
      * src/f_export.c, src/x_dialog.c and others:  Implemented
      ability to export CSV file of component sheet.

      * ToDos, README:  Updated expository material to reflect current
      state of project.

2006-07-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

      * src/gtksheet_2_2.c: Changed a g_free on a gdk_pixmap to
      g_object_unref to fix a valgrind error and the following
      output when
      exiting gattrib:  free(): invalid pointer 0x812a108!

      * src/gattrib.c, src/gtksheet_2_2.c, src/s_object.c,
      src/s_rename.c, src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_string_list.c,
      src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c,
      src/x_gtksheet.c, src/x_window.c: Changed all malloc/free calls to
      g_malloc/g_free to be consistent with libgeda

2006-06-03 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
      * src/gtksheet_2_2.c: Finally fixed annoying bug in which gattrib
      soaked up 70% of processor time.  Problem had to do with infinite
      loop of expose_events generated upon call
      to gdk_window_show(sheet->row_title_window) and
      gdk_window_show(sheet->row_title_window) in gtk_sheet_expose.  I
      removed calls to fix bug.

2006-03-12 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * lib/system-gattribrc.in: Removed load for the system-gafrc file,
        since it is loaded by libgeda first.

2006-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20060123

        * README: Updated for the new year and release.

2005-11-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
      * src/globals.c: Added setting of load_newer_backup_func to NULL.
      It is needed now libgeda checks for autosave backup files when
      opening a schematic.

2005-09-27 18:45  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * src/: gtkitementry_2_2.c, gtksheet_2_2.c: remove various compiler
          warnings

2005-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped the package version to 20050820 which will be
        a real snapshot.

2005-08-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated package version to 20050814.  This is a
        temporary version and not a real release number.

2005-07-13 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
      * src/s_visibility.c, s_table.c, s_object.c, s_toplevel.c
      amongst others.
      Made changes to enable setting attribute visibility from
      within gattrib.

2005-06-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

      * src/i_vars.c: Fixed some more variables which were shadowing the
      real variables in libgeda/noweb/i_vars.c.

2005-04-10 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
      * src/gtkitementry_1_2.c, src/gtkitementry_2_2.c,
        src/gtksheet_1_2.c src/gtksheet_2_2.c:
        Fixed segmentation fault because lacking of "default_border" and
        "default_ouside_border" properties.

2005-04-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

      * src/gattrib.c: Moved a variable decl to the top of the function to
      make gcc 2.96 happy.

2005-03-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

      * configure.ac: Removed all tests for gtk+ 1.2.x and fixed error             message if gtk+ 2.2.x is not found.

2005-03-11 12:30 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * src/gtksheet*.c:  Incorporated definitions of default_border*
      as suggested by Carlos.  A couple other possible bugfixes also.

2005-03-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20050313

2005-03-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

      * src/gattrib.c: Fixed code to allow user to specify absolute
        filenames on the command line again.

2005-03-06 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * src/s_table.c, src/x_dialog.c: Fix some uninitialized variables
      found by Dan McMahill & -wall gcc warning.

2005-02-21 05:29  Dan McMahill <danmc>

      * configure.ac, include/prototype.h, include/struct.h,
        include/x_menu.h, src/Makefile.am, src/gattrib.c, src/listsort.c,
        src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_table.c, src/s_toplevel.c,
        src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c, src/x_gtksheet.c: Fix many
        instances of non-void functions not having return values.  Most
        of these were simply changed to void functions since nothing
        seemed to be expecting a return value.  While here, garbage
        collect several unused variables to make the compiler warnings
        easier to dig through.  Also if we're using gcc, then turn on
        -Wall.

2005-02-21 03:58  Dan McMahill <danmc>

      * autogen.sh: avoid using the '-path' primary to find(1) as it's an
        extension to posix.2 and is not supported on some operating
        systems such as solaris.  Now we can autogen.sh on solaris 9.

2005-02-20  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

      * src/gattrib.c (gattrib_main): Adapted for new logging system.

2005-02-19  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

      * src/globals.c: Added definition of picture_draw_func after
      adding picture support to libgeda.

2005-02-15 18:32  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * src/x_dialog.c: Modified GTK buttons slightly so the captions
      fit the button, and the button usage matches the text.

2005-02-14 22:31  Dan McMahill <danmc>

      * src/: gtkextra-marshal.c, gtkitementry_1_2.c, listsort.c: add
        some missing config.h inclusions

2005-02-14 22:27  Dan McMahill <danmc>

      * src/x_dialog.c: - move the config.h inclusion higher up so the
        protected inclusion of string.h doesn't fail.

        - fix a format string/# of arguments mismatch in a warning
        string.

2005-02-13 11:30  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * src/s_table.c: Fixed syntax bug (doubled ;;) in
      s_table_add_toplevel_pin_items_to_pin_table.

2005-02-13 01:40  Dan McMahill <danmc>

      * src/s_string_list.c: fix 2 places where a pointer to an int was
        being cast to an int and used as an int when we really wanted to
        dereference the pointer instead.

2005-02-12  Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * src/gattrib.c, src/i_vars.c, src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c,
      * src/x_fileselect.c:  Fixed program to compile and run after
      Patrick's refactoring of libgeda.  Also made fileselect
      dialog stay on top of main window when gattrib is invoked with
      no args on cmd line.

2005-02-12  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

      * src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c: Beautify buttons (use GTK stock).

2005-02-08 12:33  Dan McMahill <danmc>

      * include/prototype.h, src/g_rc.c, src/g_register.c, src/gattrib.c:
        get rid of deprecated guile gh_* functions and replace them with
        the currently (guile-1.6) supported interface.

2005-02-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

      * src/gattrib.c, src/s_attrib.c, src/s_object.c:
      * src/s_sheet_data.c, src/s_string_list.c, src/s_table.c:
      * src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c, src/x_fileselect.c:
      * src/x_gtksheet.c, src/x_window.c: Replaced u_basic_strdup() and
      u_basic_strdup_multiple() by GLib functions.

      * src/gattrib.c, src/x_fileselect.c:  Made it use GLib's
      G_DIR_SEPARATOR* instead of libgeda's *_SEPARATER_*.

2005-01-27 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * src/gattrib.c: Changes made to enable correct opening
      of schematics in foreign directories.  Changes detailed
      in libgeda ChangeLog.


2005-01-22 (Later in same day) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * x_dialog.c, s_toplevel.c:  Rewrote missing symbol dialog box
      so that only one box is thrown up in event of missing symbols.

2005-01-22 (Later in same day) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * include/prototype.h, src/(s_attrib.c, s_sheet_data.c,
      s_table.c, s_toplevel.c,  x_dialog.c): New feature -- gattrib
      now handles slotted components correctly.

2005-01-22 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * src/s_toplevel.c, src/s_attrib.c, src/s_sheet_data, Makefile.am:
      Fixed bug where pre-existing
      attribs were deleted instead of being replaced.  Added new fcn
      in s_attrib.c as part of this bugfix.

      * include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, include/x_menu.h,
      src/gattrib.c, src/gtkitementry_2_2.c,src/gtksheet_2_2.c,
      src/x_dialog.c:  New feature -- check for unsaved chages
      before leaving program.

      * configure.ac:  Added --enable-debug as configure option.

2005-01-21 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * src/s_toplevel.c, src/x_dialog.c: Fix bug where only one
      page of design was searched for missing attribs.  Also updated
      missing_sym dialog box.

2005-01-19 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * src/(s_object.c, gattrib.c, s_toplevel.c,x_fileselect.c,
      x_dialog.c): Incorporated pop-up window which notifies
      user if a component is found with no sym file.

2004-12-28 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * lib/system-gattribrc.in:  Changed to refer to system-gafrc.

2004-12-28 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

      * configure.ac: Changed the call to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to take
      the GEDA_VERSION so that packages get created with the right
      version number

      * src/s_toplevel.c, x_dialog.c: Added a few #ifdef HAS_GTK22 tests
      to get gattrib to build using gtk12.  The addition tests in x_dialog.c
      are probably okay, but the test in s_toplevel.c needs to be fixed
      properly.

      * Makefile.am: Added missing file to EXTRA_DIST variable

2004-12-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20041228

2004-07-27  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

        *  Ported code to GTK+-2.X.  Re-wrote Makefile.am & configure.ac.  Split
         gtksheet.c into two versions, one for GTK-1.2 and one for GTK-2.X.
         (Both copied from gtkextra.sf.net.)

      *  Many fixes related to moving to GTK-2.X

      *  Incorporated Ales' fix for "for" loop which had i=i++ construct.

      *  Eliminated spurious GTK warnings by testing for NULL in arguments
         before calling functions in gtksheet.c.

      *  Removed several extraneous files originally bundled with GtkSheet.

      *  Modified gattrib to work with soon-to-be-released libgeda 20040710.

      *  Implemented alphabetic sort of master_comp_list.

      *  Placed references to g_rc_reset_component_library and other
         Guile fcns into g_register to enable Sri's RC customized files.

        *  Fixed bug in which a loop was terminating early, causing
         large portions of some designs to be not processed.

      *  Added code to catch a cond where a design with no components
         (i.e. no refdeses) or no modifiable attributes (i.e. no attribs
         other than refdes) would cause a segfault.  Now program just
         exits with an error message.

      *  Fixed bug in which graphical objects were not discarded
         during the "add master list" loop.  This generated a
         spurious warning message.

      *  Fixed configure.ac to fix the GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X problem
         originally identified by Dan, and seen again by Sribalan
         Santhanam in rel 20040304.  Hopefully I fixed the bug this
         time!

      *  Fixed some compilation issues related to GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X.
         Dan McMahill discovered the problem, and also provided the
         patches fixing it.  Thanks, Dan!

      *  "make install" now correctly installs system-gattribrc into
         the place where the gEDA RC files live.  I had forgotten to
         include this into the last release, and you had to do it by
         hand.

2004-02-21  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

      *  Initial release.

2003-12-05  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

      * Started hacking.
