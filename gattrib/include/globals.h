 * \brief Global variable declarations
 *
 * \section sdb_note SDB note about philosophy behind globals
 *
 * I made the "GedaToplevel project" and all the GTK window stuff into
 * global variables.  I know that this is supposedly bad programming form.
 * However, here are some observations:
 * - I wanted to use gEDA's GedaToplevel structure as much as possible, at
 *    least to hold info about the design's netlist & components.
 *    The GedaToplevel strucuture is architected to hold info about gschem's
 *    window also.  HOwever, gschem's windows are architected differently
 *    than mine in gattrib.  This is because my windowing system does
 *    completely different things, and also uses the GtkSheet widget, which
 *    is architected completely differently from GedaToplevel.
 * - Since I couldn't easily or naturally cram my windowing scheme into
 *    GedaToplevel (or so I think), I decided to use a separate set of windows
 *    from those defined under GedaToplevel for my application.
 * - The problem arises when using callbacks.  Callbacks from GTK allow
 *    only one argument to be passed.  Given the way I set up the menu bar,
 *    I didn't have easy acces to the information inside both the GtkSHeet
 *    objects *and* the GedaToplevel stuff while only having one callback
 *    argument.  This makes it hard to have access to e.g. a GtkSheet window
 *    and a list of files (in GedaToplevel) simultaneously.
 * - Therefore, I decided to make both the window stuff and GedaToplevel
 *    globals.
 * - Similarly, because I couldn't cram the SHEET_DATA struct into any
 *    hook in GedaToplevel, I just made it a global also.
 * - Finally, in my defense, in gschem and gnetlist, (GedaToplevel *w_current
 *    or pr_current) is passed  to almost every function.  Since it
 *    is just a pointer to a huge struct of stuff, manipulating
 *    the stuff in the struct has a global
 *    effect.  That is, manipulating w_current (or pr_current) has side
 *    effects, so it is basically a global anyway.  The real problem with
 *    globals occurs when you have a global variable caled "i" or "temp"
 *    which conflicts with a global in a module written by somebody else.
 *    Since pr_current is a very uncommon name, this should not be a
 *    problem here.  Therefore, I decided
 *    to make life easy for myself dealing with callbacks by making both
 *    the windows and GedaToplevel global variables.
 *
 * If there is a better way to solve this problem, I'd like to hear it.
