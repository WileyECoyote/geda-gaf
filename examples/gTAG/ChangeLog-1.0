    * gTAG/sch/gTAG-ucont.sch: Update CONN1 header20-1.sym -> header20-2-1.sym.

2015-12-07  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gTAG/sht/: Update sheet symbols in gTAG example; add missing attributes
      for pin types, refdes, device, footprint, and description as needed to
      comply with gsymcheck:

          * gTAG/sht/copyleft.sym
          * gTAG/sht/gTAG-consio.sym
          * gTAG/sht/gTAG-jtagio.sym
          * gTAG/sht/gTAG-psu.sym
          * gTAG/sht/gTAG-ucont.sym

2015-12-06  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gTAG/sch/gTAG-consio.sch: Add value=SN75240PWR to U40 and changed the
      footprint from DIP8 to TSSOP8, was the only thru-hole IC, now all are
      SMD.

    * gTAG/sch/gTAG-jtagio.sch: Update foot-print for CONN4 from conn_jtag
      to CONN_JTAG, which should maybe should be called CONN_JTAG-8.

    * gTAG/sch/gTAG-psu.sch: Reposition attributes to improve appearance.

    * gTAG/sch/gTAG-ucont.sch: Remove foot-print attribute for J1 so the
      foot-print in the symbol is used, effectively updating the foot-print
      from JUMPER2 to JUMPER-2.

2015-11-30  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * lightning_detector/bom: Update Terry's script: Change "uref" to
      "refdes" and corresponding char count=7.

    * lightning_detector/sym/2N4401.sym: Add pin type and label attributes.

    * lightning_detector/sym/2N4403.sym: Add pin type and label attributes.

    * lightning_detector/sym/.gitignore: remove file, not needed.

    * lightning_detector/lightning.sch: Update in-1.sym, add attribure nobom
      to io symbols, is in bad shape.

    * RF_Amp/sym/Q_Model.sym: Add pin type and label attributes.

2015-11-17  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gTAG/.sch increase font sizes and regenerated .ps files.

2015-11-13  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gTAG/sym/24C64-gt.sym: Use local symbols for EEPROM, none of the
      geda-gaf exmples have net= defined in a local symbol.

    * gTAG/sch/gTAG-psu.sch: Change Schottkys to dash 1, with DO-41 feet.

    * gTAG/sch/gTAG-consio.sch: Name unnamed nets; GTAG_PROT_A, GTAG_PROT_B,
      which gnetlist ignores because they was connecting a graphical NC to
      a NC PIN, still gnetlist should NOT report these as unamed_xx!

    * gTAG/sch/gTAG-ucont.sch: Name unnamed nets:

               * GTAG_NDISCON
               * GTAG_SCL
               * GTAG_SDA
               * GTAG_RDY2
               * GTAG_RDY4
               * GTAG_RDY5
               * GTAG_USBDM
               * GTAG_USBDP
               * GTAG_PB[0-7]
               * GTAG_RESV4
               * GTAG_XCLKSEL
               * GTAG_XSEL
               * GTAG_WAKEUP
               * GTAG_MEM_A0

2015-11-12  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * sch/gTAG-jtagio.sch: Add net names for jtag signals between the
      connectors and io buffers.

    * sch/gTAG-ucont.sch: Update footprint for conn4 (delete attached
      footprint).

    * sch/gTAG-psu.sch: Replace zero ohm resistors R30 and R31 with
      1N5817 Schottky diodes, adjust attribute positions and visibilities.

    * bom/gTAG.bom: Regenerated the BOM.

    * sym/CY7C64603-52NC-gt.sym: Resequenced pins in the file, change
      pin number 43 to pintype=in, even though is an io pin in order to
      suppress warning (the only warning) from DRC2.

2015-11-11  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * sch/gTAG-psu.sch: Clean-up drawing; adjust attribute positions
      visibility, add net names gtag_input_power and MAX882_LBI.

2015-11-06  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

	* Updated all files to the latest gEDA/gaf version and cleaned
      drawings, aka revised attribute positions and visibility.

	* Updated all symbols latest footprints, capitalizing symbol file
      names, replaced local complexes.

	* Reorganized example creating sub-directories bom/ sch/ sht/ sym/
      and ps and located files into the new sub-directories. Everything
      seems to work okay and this shows user a method that can be used
      to organize project files.

	* crdist.sh: Updated script to use gTAG_Files variable, this seems
      more maintainable.

    * gafrc: Update search directories.

2003-05-22  Ales Hvezda (ahvezda@seul.org)

	* Updated all sym/sch files to the latest gEDA/gaf version.

2003-01-11  Ales Hvezda (ahvezda@seul.org)

	* Updated all files to the current gEDA/gaf file formats.

	* Corrected CONN1 offset problem.

	* Re-ran gnetlist and recreated netlist and bom.

	* Added attribs file for bom generation.

	* Added gschlasrc file.

	* Removed COPYING (as it is now one directory higher)

	* Added Makefile.am and added all the files into SEUL gEDA cvs.

2001-02-12  Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* Added proper power-on-reset from the MAX882 to the u-controller
	  after suggestion from Luis Miguel Brugarolas <lmbruga@sire.es>.
	  R1 and C1 removed. Added is R33, R32 and R34. U30 is changed.


2001-02-11  Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* Added the lines
	  (hierarchy-netname-mangle "disabled")
          (hierarchy-uref-mangle "disabled")
	  to gnetlistrc so PCB likes the PCB netlist gnetlist generates.


2001-02-08  Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* Added C20 after suggestion from Andrew Dyer.
	* Changed distribution script so the generated PCB netlist is
	  called gTAG-pcb.net due to possible name clash with PCB layout.
	* Added R20-R23 after suggestion from Andrew Dyer.
