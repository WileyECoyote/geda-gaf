      going to optimize out anyways.

    * src/s_check.c: Capture (new) return from s_check_missing_attribute
      in s_check_missing_attributes, and if a Pin object was missing a
      pinlabel or pintype, then attempt to retrieve a pin number or pin

    * gsymcheck/src/s_check.c: Revised function s_check_all to check for
      graphical and directive attributes first. Add static function
      s_check_is_valid_directive and modify s_check_symbol_structure to
      skip over attributes that appear to be valid Directives. The intend
      is to allow symbols to contain "special" attributes for use with
      geda-gaf applications like gnetlist backends without specifying
      an exact strings to match an thus allowing for flexibility. The
      only requirements is that the word "directive", not case sensitive,
      be in a VALID attribute AND the word directive be immediately followed
      by and equal sign which must be followed by a non null character,
      thus:
             device=DRC_Directive=something (current scheme)
             DRC_Directive=something
             Directive=something
             SPICE_DirecTive=anything

      are ignore by gsymcheck.

   ** src/s_check.c: Update error message; remove "not continuing" from
      message in s_check_slotdef because all of the error containing this
      text all continue. Revise function s_check_missing_attribute to
      return boolean TRUE if found. Resequence functions. Remove boolean
      missing_device_attrib, is not used and code can just check for a non
      null device_attribute string.

      Add s_check_description new check for missing description and duplicates
      but not multiples.

      Revise function s_check_slotdef to scope some variables.

    * tests/Makefile.am: Organize symbol files for test and test outputs into
      separate subdirectories.

    * tests/runtest.sh: Update location of inputs and reference outputs locations
      with subdirectories and use base name without the .sym extension. Rename
      tests file like xxxinside.sym and xxxinside.output to xxx_inside.sym and
      xxx_inside.output, i.e. with an underscore in the file name.


2015-10-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/s_check.c: Add separate check for a (hypothetical) Directive attribute,
      and set a boolean in data structure TRUE if found, currently this would be
      find "device=DRC_Directive" text but allow for future directive=attributes.
      the has_directive flag is used later in s_check_device().

      Add check for ordinary symbols, i.e not graphical and not containing
      a directive, symbols to have warning issued if the device value is not
      found in the file name.

      Replace g_list_next with iter->next.

      Add Doxygen comments for s_check_graphical.

      SYMCHECK to s_check_symbol, removed passing toplevel, formally pr_current
      which was not used by s_check_symbol, and confusing p_current = page.
      Just conditionally print the filename in s_check_all before calling
      s_check_symbol. Completed Doxygen comments for both s_check_all and
      s_check_symbol.

      loops in function s_symstruct_free to free the message strings and call
      g_list_free for each list and added Doxygen comment block.

    * Code Enhancement: Extend functionality

        * src/Makefile.am: Changed AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = $(GEDA_AUTO_MAKE_OPTIONS)

        * tests/Makefile.am: Added AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = $(GEDA_AUTO_MAKE_OPTIONS)
          $(GEDA_AUTOMAKE_TEST_OPTIONS)

2013-09-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/*.c General review and updated copyright date. Converted TAB to
          spaces.

2013-05-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/Makefile.am: Change -I$(abs_top_builddir)/include to
        -I$(top_srcddir)/include. Don't know where i got abs_top_build.
        Does not work for distcheck or on Mint (and probably Ubuntu) with
        automake ver? autoconf v?

        * tests/duplicate_net.output: Updated file
        * tests/misplaced_attributes.output: Updated file

2013-02-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * Added "model-name" to the list of acceptable attributes;

2012-12-30 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/Makefile.am: Revised "includes" again, the gsymcheck_CPPFLAGS
        was not past to C with some installations. Used AM_CFLAGS instead.

2012-10-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/s_check.c: Added three new types to the list of acceptable
          attributes; "footprints", "pins", and "spicetype". These three
          additions were selected based on popular demand, i.e., these
          were the three most common "extra" attributes that were detected
          while reviewing the entire symbols library. All were commented
          out during the review, and now these comments have been removed,
          see symbols ChangeLog.

2012-10-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/Makefile.am: Revised "includes" like was done with gschem,
          to clarify exactly where to look for include files, to better
          organize flags, and to eliminate redundent inclusions of paths.

        * src/s_check.c: Revised check for "the same number in a pinnumber
          attribute and in a net attribute". A previous patch removed the
          error message and later a "warning" was added instead, see commit:
          77e0e0f4ffe9573316ebdfdc12d319ccff1074a. This warning was removed
          because usage of the form net=sig:1 is sited on the geda-gaf web
          site in an example of HOWTO use the net attribute. Furthermore,
          use of the word "Warning" may suggest to maintainers and users
          that many of the library symbols are deficient or sub-standard.
          To deal with this, the message was downgraded to a "Notice:" and
          the message is only shown in verbose mode but does not trigger
          an error or warning.
          Updated, FSF address and copyrights info.

        * src/g_register.c: Updated, FSF address and copyrights info.
        * src/g_rc.c: Updated, FSF address.
        * src/globals: Updated, FSF address.
        * src/parsecmd.c: Updated, FSF address.
        * src/s_symstruct.c: Updated, FSF address.

2012-10-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        file into gschem's file.

2006-09-17 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/struct.h, src/s_check.c, src/s_symstruct.c:
	Applied patch #1558391 by Jeff Mallatt, slightly modified so
	it doesn't use goto's. Thanks.

	Counts the number of distinct pinnumbers specified in
	all slotdef= attributes. Uses that number, plus the
	number of net= pins, to compare with the "footprint
	size" when checking for that warning.

	The code used to simply use numpins*numslots, which
	doesn't account for the possibility of the same
	pinnumber being used in more than one slotdef= attribute.

	For an example of a symbol where this matters, see
	'analog/dual-opamp-1.sym'.

2006-09-13 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/s_check.c: Applied patch #1558122 by Jeff Mallatt.

	* include/pincounts.h, include/struct.h, include/prototype.h,
	src/s_check.c, src/s_symstruct.c: Applied patch by Jim Duchek which
	adds several important tests to gsymcheck:

		net=Vcc:8,15,14 (for example) is now checked against
		the pinnumber= attribs for duplicates.	footprint=
		is checked to get the proper pincount (I included some
		support for special cases like TO92, which doesn't
		quite have 92 pins :), and the number of pins defined
		vs. the number of pins that SHOULD be defined is compared.
		Total pins are found by: total = num_net_pins + (numslots
		* numpins).  Of course if numslots == 0 that multiplier
		doesn't happen.

	* tests/incorrect_footprint.sym duplicate_net.sym: Added a couple
	test symbols to exercise the above patch
