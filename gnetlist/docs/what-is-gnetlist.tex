   What is gnetlist?

   gnetlist is the netlister for the gEDA suite. gnetlist is a command
   line netlist extraction and generation tool. gnetlist accepts one or
   more electronic schematics as input, and outputs a netlist. A netlist
   is a machine interpretable description of the way that components in an
   electronic circuit are connected together, and is commonly used as the
   input to a PCB layout program such as pcb or to a simulator such as
   gnucap. Currently, gnetlist supports over 30 output formats.
