.SH NAME
gnetlistrc - gEDA/gaf Netlist Extraction and Generation Configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnetlistrc
@GEDARCDIR@/system-gnetlistrc, $GEDARCDIR/gnetlistrc, ./gnetlistrc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsystem-gnetlistrc\fR configuration file is used to set system-wide
defaults to be applied when running \fBgnetlist\fR.
.PP
Users may create an optional configuration file, \fBgnetlistrc\fR in their home
configuration directory which will be used to override the system-wide defaults
file. The location of configuration files can be specified using the GEDARCDIR
environment variable but this will effect other gEDA/gaf applications.
The file \fBgnetlistrc\fR in the current working directory is also used.
.PP
Additional \fBgnetlistrc\fR files may be in the current working directory
or a parent there of. The search for a local \fBgnetlistrc\fR terminates
once a \fBgnetlistrc\fR file has been found or the root of the drive is
reached. Configuration settings in the local \fBgnetlistrc\fR files override
those in both the system-wide defaults and the users home directory.
.PP
The \fBgnetlistrc\fR files are written in the Scheme programming language
in the form of keyword-value pairs and are processed by the Scheme interupter.
This manual attempts to explain all of keywords recognized by \fBgnetlist\fR.

.SH SYNTAX
.PP
Keywords and mode strings are case sensitive. Blank lines are ignored.
Lines beginning with a semicolon (';') are comments, and are ignored.
Note that it is possible to include keywords for \fBlibgeda\fR in \fBgnetlistrc\fR
files, this is not commonly done.

.SH KEYWORDS
.TP 8
\fBgnetlist-version\fR
Specifies the version of this file.  This number is used to make sure
that the rc file is compatible with the version of gschem that is
being run. The end user should *not* change this value. This should
not be confused with the gnetlist:get-version scheme API function
that returns the \fBgnetlist\fR dotted version string.
.TP 8
\fBnet-naming-priority\fR
Specifies which netname has priority if a net is found with two names.
If this variable is set to "netattrib" then any netname specified with the
net= attribute is used as the netname. Likewise if this variable is set to
"netname" then any netname conflict is resolved using the netname= value.
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-traversal\fR
Determines if the hierarchy is traversed or not. If this is disabled then
\fBgnetlist\fR will not go down searching for any underlying sources. The value
can be "enabled" or "disabled".
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-uref-mangle\fR
Controls if uref names are mangled to make them unique when traversing down
into the hierarchy. If this options is disabled then reference designators
are not changed. Reference designators MUST be unique throughout the entire
hierarchy or bad things might happen. Underlying schematics cannot reused.
The value can be "enabled" or "disabled".
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-netname-mangle\fR
Controls if net names are mangled to make them unique when traversing
down into the hierarchy.  If this is disabled then the net names are not
changed and it is the user's responsibility to make sure they are unique.
This basically has the effect of making all same named nets in the entire
hierarchy be electrically connected. It is recommeneded that this option
not be disabled. This option is provided for advanced user. The value
can be "enabled" or "disabled".
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-netattrib-mangle\fR
Controls if net created by using the net= attribute are renamed to make
them unique when traversing down into the hierarchy. If this is disabled
then the net= created nets are not changed. This feature is handy to have
global nets which spawn the entire hierarchy (like power or ground nets).
Make sure you know what you are doing if you disable this option. The
value can be "enabled" or "disabled".
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-uref-separator\fR
Specifies what the separator string between the various hierarchy tags
for all urefs. This string can also be "" (empty) to specify that no
chars should be used.  This keyword is ignored if hierarchy-uref-mangle
is disabled (though a default "/" is used in this case, and then all the
internal mangling is removed so it is not seen by the user). This keyword
is used in conjunction with the respective hierarchy-*-order keyword.
The default separator is a "/" characters.
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-netname-separator\fR
Specifies what the separator string between the various hierarchy tags
for net= created nets.  This string can also be "" (empty) to specify
that no chars should be used.  This keyword is ignored if
hierarchy-netattrib-mangle is disabled.  This keyword is used in
conjunction with the respective hierarchy-*-order keyword.
The default separator is a "/" characters.
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-netattrib-separator\fR
Specifies what the separator string between the various hierarchy tags
for net= created nets.  This string can also be "" (empty) to specify
that no chars should be used.  This keyword is ignored if
hierarchy-netattrib-mangle is disabled.  This keyword is used in
conjunction with the respective hierarchy-*-order keyword. The
default separator is a "/" characters.
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-uref-order\fR
Specifies the order in which the hierarchy tags are applied to all
urefs. The value can be "append" or "prepend".
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-netname-order\fR
Specifies the order in which the hierarchy tags are applied to all
nets. The value can be "append" or "prepend".
.TP 8
\fBhierarchy-netattrib-order\fR
Specifies the order in which the hierarchy tags are applied to nets created
using the net= attribute. The value can be "append" or "prepend".
.TP 8
\fBunnamed-netname\fR
Specifies the default string which is placed in front of all nets that
have not been explicitly named by the user (using the netname= attribute
in the schematic). The is default "unnamed_net".
.TP 8
\fBunnamed-busname\fR
Specifies the default string which is placed in front of all buses that
have not been explicitly named by the user.
(This is not currently useful, since \fBgnetlist\fR does not netlist buses).
The is default "unnamed_bus".
