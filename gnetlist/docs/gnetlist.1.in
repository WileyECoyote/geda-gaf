gnetlist - gEDA/gaf Netlist Extraction and Generation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnetlist
[\fIOPTION\fR ...] [\fB-g\fR \fIBACKEND\fR] [ \fIhelp | version\fR ] [\fI--\fR] \fIFILE\fR ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fBgnetlist\fR is a netlist extraction and generation tool, and is part
of the gEDA (GPL Electronic Design Automation) toolset.  gnetlist accepts
one or more electronic schematics as input, and outputs a netlist. A netlist
is a machine-interpretable description of the way that components in an
electronic circuit are connected together, and is commonly used as the
input to a PCB layout program such as \fBpcb\fR(1) or to a simulator such
as \fBgnucap\fR(1).

A normal \fBgnetlist\fR run is carried out in two steps.  First, the
\fBgnetlist\fR front-end loads the specified human-readable schematic
\fIFILE\fRs, and compiles them to an in-memory netlist description.
Next, a `backend' is used to export the connection and component data
to one of many supported netlist formats.

\fBgnetlist\fR is extensible, using the Scheme programming language.

"gnetlistrc".
.TP 8
\fB-i\fR
After the schematic files have been loaded and compiled, and after all
Scheme files have been loaded, but before running the backend, enter a
Scheme read-eval-print loop.
.TP 8
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print usage and information on options. This is a positional argument.
When given after the backend is specified, information specific to the
backend will be displayed.
.TP 8
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Prints \fBgnetlist\fR version information when used before the \fBbackend\fR
and \fBbackend\fR version information when used after the \fBbackend\fR has
been specified.
.TP 8
\fB--\fR
Treat all remaining arguments as schematic filenames. Use this if you
have a schematic filename which begins with `-'.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
These examples assume that you have a `stack_1.sch' in the current directory.
.PP
\fBgnetlist\fR requires that at least one schematic to be specified on the
command line:

.nf
	./gnetlist stack_1.sch
.ad b

.PP
This is not very useful since it does not direct \fBgnetlist\fR to do
anything.
.PP
Specify a backend name with `\-g' to get \fBgnetlist\fR to output a
netlist:

.nf
	./gnetlist \-g geda stack_1.sch
.ad b

.PP
The netlist output will be written to a file called `output.net'
in the current working directory.

.PP
You can specify the output filename by using the `\-o' option:

.nf
	./gnetlist \-g geda stack_1.sch \-o /tmp/stack.netlist
.ad b

.PP
Output will now be directed to `/tmp/stack.netlist'.

.PP
You could run (for example) the `spice-sdb' backend against the
schematic if you specified `\-g spice-sdb', or you could generate a
bill of materials for the schematic using `\-g partslist1'.

.PP
To obtain a Scheme prompt to run Scheme expressions directly, you can
use the `\-i' option.

.nf
	./gnetlist \-i stack_1.sch
.ad b

.PP
\fBgnetlist\fR will load `stack_1.sh', and then enter an interactive
Scheme read-eval-print loop.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 8
.B GEDADATA
Specifies the search directory for Scheme and rc files. The default
is `${prefix}/share/gEDA'.
.TP 8
.B GEDADATARC
