    * Makefile.am: Add rule for update-gmo to allow compiling translations
      from application folder.

    * src/Makefile.am: Replace datadir/locale with localedir so that
      the second argument to bindtextdomain is the actual location
      where the compiled mo files are to be installed. Add @LIBINTL@
      to LDADD so that gnetlist is linked against libintl if required.

    * src/gnetlist.c: Revise main to setup locale and bind translation
      text to the geda-gnetlist domain.

2017-01-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * include/Makefile.am: Append local gettext.h to noinst_HEADERS.

    * src/: Replace square brackets with double quotes for the file names
      and format in order to eliminate format specifiers in translatable
      strings:

      scope of uref and eliminate pin array, replace sscanf and geda_sprintf
      in s_hierarchy_remove_uref_mangling using a similar technique and add
      comments. Valgrind backend exp-sgcheck is now reporting zero errors.

    * Revert "gnetlist/test: replace line endings crlf->lf"

      This reverts commit be4a26bb2f44c0f7e38cfde242940880e9dad87d. See
      commit 291502025248298b4d42cfbd80ff605dc62c3f92 (02/27/2008). The
      crlf were intentional and I unwittingly replaced so put them back.

      This poses a problem with git which normally attempts to maintain the
      line-endings but will remove the crlf under certain circumstances.
      Adding gitattributes files to specify the line-ending to be used for
      the specific files identified to intentionally have crlf line-endings
      so that git will know the correct line-endings (and hopefully this
      will never ever happen again).

    * tests/.gitattributes: Contains list of files in the tests/ directory
      that should have crlf line-ending.

    * tests/common/outputs/.gitattributes: Contains list of files in the
      tests/common/outputs/ directory that should have crlf line-ending.

2016-10-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/parsecmd.c: Include program name in the version output message,
      Remove gaf from gEDA/gaf in usage output because the latter looks
      like it was output from the gaf program, remove the trailing forward
      slash ".org" and add link http://pcb.geda-project.org.

      Vladimir Zhbanov, commit a3bc7cb7ed8a902b657e826a87273146e23bf7de:
      gnetlist: Improved checking of attribute identity.

      gnetlist warns the user if several components with the same refdes
      have same named attributes with different values. So far, it also
      yielded the warning in the case when some of such components missed
      the attribute in question. There is no point to have, say, footprint=
      attached on several slots of a slotted part, so this check is now
      omitted for symbol instances having no requested attribute.

      This change is not backward compatible with previous gnetlist behaviour.

    Variation of modifications by Peter Brett <peter@peter-b.co.uk>,

    commit/a1947a4eebb27826ccba571f3f313a316fa695bc:

    gnetlist: Workaround some poor behaviour in rename tracking

    A memory exhaustion bug was reported in gnetlist, where netlisting a
    set of similar schematics was causing excess allocation by the rename
    tracking code.  Testing suggested that `s_rename_add_lowlevel()` was
    being called repeatedly with identical `src` and `dest` arguments.

    * src/s_rename.c: Add GHashTable *rename_table, functions s_rename_
      compare_strings and s_rename_have_rename_record,, Revise s_rename_init
      to create the hash table and s_rename_destroy_all to destroy the
      table. Revise to s_rename_add_lowlevel to first check if rename is
      the same as last and if not then check hash table and only add unique
      rename records. Probably should just use the hash table alone and
      eliminate the list if pointer to RENAME structures. Add/revise Doxygen
      comments.

2016-06-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/s_rename.c: Make s_rename_all_lowlevel static.

2016-06-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/s_hierarchy.c: Revise s_hierarchy_post_process to refrain from
      blurting "Missing I/O symbol" if quiet_mode is set.

    * src/s_net.c: Revise s_net_name_search to suppress yelping upon finding
      a duplicate net name if quiet_mode is set.

    * src/s_rename.c: Revise function s_rename_add, eliminating int flag and
      pass quiet_mode for the third argument to s_rename_search instead of
      FALSE.

    * src/s_traverse.c: Reduce scope of variables in s_traverse_sheet and
      s_traverse_hierarchy_sheet, eliminate unnecessary initialization of
      is_hierarchy in s_traverse_sheet and s_traverse_hierarchy_sheet, and
      netattrib_pinnum in s_traverse_net.

    * src/vams_misc.c: Eliminate variables "o_current" and "val" in function
      vams_get_attribs_list and use accessor o_attrib_get_attached_attribs,
      add Doxygen comments.

    * scheme/gnet-drc.scm: Close output port after displaying message when
      attrib file is not found (even though guile will close the port).

    * tests/drc2/Makefile.am: Create a local sym directory and copy resistor-

    * tests/common/run_backend_tests.sh: Simplify trouble-shooting; generate
      a diff in the parent directory when failures occur.

    * tests/gafrc: Add new file with log-directory entry to create and write
      logs to tests/logs.

    * tests/common/inputs/gafrc: Add log-directory key-word to use ../../logs,
      combine with the previous revision, all 1747 logs files generated during
      the test are contained to the tests/logs directory.

    * tests/Makefile.am: Remove the logs directory from the builddir to satisfy
      distcheck. Suppress output from commands during pre and post cleanup,
      combine rm arguments.

      for output from libgeda, and test $VERBOSE when reporting input variables

    * scheme/Makefile.am: Suppress code blups in local rules, both branches of
      both local rules output status messages.

2016-01-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * tests/common/outputs: Regenerate spice and spice-sdb outputs, the
      former because the model is now inserted into the output rather than
      "A1 <No valid value attribute found>" and the later because the word
      "model" was removed from  delineator lines.

2016-01-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * scheme/gnet-spice.scm: Add function write-prologue and write-model,
      spice-sdb, should probably be in common spice. Iterate refdes in two
      passes and include model files, almost makes old spice usable.

    * scheme/spice-common.scm: Remove the word "model" from delineator lines
      and rename argument model-filename to filename in spice:insert-text-file,
      the function does not know what the data is that is being included.

2016-01-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/s_traverse.c: Replace macros:

          * GINT_TO_POINTER with (void*)(long)
          * GPOINTER_TO_INT with (int)(long)

2015-12-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gnetlist/backend-getopt.scm: Add function option-warning and use in
      place of option-error if the option is not known to the backend so
      that the bom and bom2 backends do not error-out when each would other
      wise produce normal output. Only bom and bom2 utilize backend-getopt,
      and these still function correctly with the proper arguments and
      this help to reduce scheme backtraces on the console.

    * scheme/: Change marge-sort-* to merge-sort-*, it was either that or
      marge-simpson, maybe lost in translation?, in files:

          * scheme/gnet-partslist1.scm
          * scheme/gnet-partslist2.scm
          * scheme/gnet-partslist3.scm
          * scheme/partslist-common.scm

    * scheme/partslist-common.scm: Tweak get-parts-table to exclude packages
      with an attribute nobom=1.

    * tests/common/run_backend_tests.sh: Revert setting debug if DEBUG_TESTS
      set in environment. Revise to fail if the output file was not generated
      so that the skip clause is reached if there is no reference file and
      return the fail count not total-pass since bom and bom2 fail when passed
      backend parameters for the spice routines because bom and bom2 use the
      backend-getopt routines.

    * tests/common/outputs: Add outputs:

          * bom/JD_Include_nomunge-output.net
          * bom/JD_Include-output.net
          * bom/JD_nomunge-output.net

          * bom2/TwoStageAmp_Include-output.net
          * bom2/TwoStageAmp_Sort-output.net

    * tests/common/inputs/TwoStageAmp.sch: Add attribute nobom=1 to refdes
      Vinput and VCC.

      by Vladimir Zhbanov, commit a7d58b6871c74dfe6b60da11d616b28aade84fd7: Add
      backend tests for verbose mode.

      While this significantly increases the time of 'make check', one more gnetlist
      option is now tested. Affects-bug: lp-1497659.

2015-11-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Gnetlist Meet GedaList

    * src/s_hierarchy.c: Free source_net_name in s_hierarchy_post_process after
      return from s_hierarchy_setup_rename.

    * src/s_netattrib.c: Free string (value) o_attrib_search_attached_attribs_by_name
      in second For loop of s_netattrib_net_search if a floating net is found with the
      given pin number. Excellent, now all we need to do is...

    * include/prototype.h: Add declarations for new functions:

              * s_cpinlist_destroy_or_report
              * s_net_destroy_or_report
              * s_netlist_destroy_or_report

      Remove declaration for functions:

              * s_traverse_init

      Rename declaration for functions:

              * s_traverse_start to s_traverse_process.

    * src/g_netlist.c: Revise gnetlist_quit to call s_netlist_destroy_or_report twice,
      once with the regular netlist and graphical, pass a pointer to a list to collect
      a list of pointers to strings to be freed and destroying structures related to
      both list. Call s_page_delete_list on the toplevel before releasing toplevel.

    * src/s_netlist.c: Add function s_netlist_destroy_or_report to traverse netlist
      and release allocations or add pointers to list, calls s_cpinlist_destroy_or_
      report to traverse the pin list.

    * src/s_cpinlist.c: Add function s_cpinlist_destroy_or_report, similar to the
      s_netlist_destroy_or_report, call s_net_destroy_or_report for each net, aka
      connected pin.

    * src/s_net.c : Add function s_net_destroy_or_report, similar to the preceeding
      two functions; frees pin_labels and connected_to and adds net_name to the given
      list.

    * src/s_hierarchy.c: Revise function s_hierarchy_remove_urefconn to return a
      list of pointers that were set to NULL in the net list. The list is returned
      to callers s_hierarchy_setup_rename and s_hierarchy_remove_compsite_all where
      members are uniquely added to the GedaList passed from s_hierarchy_post_process.
      After s_hierarchy_post_process compiles both list, the list of pointers is
      released using geda_list_free_full and then destroyed, thus releasing memory
      for designator strings, both composited like "S1/U1" and singular like "S2",
      that were renamed by s_rename_add_lowlevel to something like "S4" after
      s_rename_all returned to s_hierarchy_post_process.

    * src/s_traverse.c: Make s_traverse_init static, just call from s_traverse_process
      (formerly s_traverse_start). Move g_hash_table_new to s_traverse_process and
      call g_hash_table_destroy before leaving s_traverse_process. Move visit_table
      to uninitialize segment.

    * src/i_vars.c: Add function i_vars_finalize and call from gnetlist_quit to
      release the default strings used to set top-level defaults if not encoun-
      tered while processing the rc file.

    * src/: Add/Edit Doxygen comments.

    * scheme/gnet-drc2.scm: Revert DRC_Directive back to device=DRC_Directive,
      temporarily.

    * src/s_netattrib.c: Revise function s_netattrib_net_search to check for a
      NULL return from s_netattrib_extract_netname, make net_name a local to
      each of the For loops, not sure what the For loops really do since there
      should only be one attribute having the given pinnumber and having TWO
      does not generate an error using the DRC2 backend but does generate and
      error if two get shorted as a results of having two net= attributes.

      Release temp_netname in s_netattrib_return_netname.

2015-11-11 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/gnetlist.c: Add call to u_program_mem_set_vtable in function main_prog

    * src/gnetlist.c: Tweak "would-be" main line code; Defer checking and setting
      the default output file name and getting the cwd directory.

    * src/s_netattrib.c: Tweek function s_netattrib_extract_netname; start index
      1 instead of zero because a netname cannot be zero lenght, eliminate early
      return and free the string if was malformed. Add comments with example.
      Eliminate reallocation of the string for new_cpin->nets->connected_to in
      function s_netattrib_create_pins and move local char *connected_in to the
      DEBUG compile, adding the pointer to the debug message.

      Free net name before over-writing the pointer in s_netattrib_create_pins.

      Add Doxygen comments for defines PIN_NET_PREFIX and PIN_NET_PREFIX and add
      Doxygen comments for functions:

          * s_netattrib_connected_string_get_pinnum
          * s_netattrib_extract_netname
          * s_netattrib_create_pins

    * src/s_traverse.c: Include <geda_diagnostics.h> and add start and
      stop macros in function s_traverse_sheet, rename variable "temp" to "value".
      Add function s_traverse_hierarchy_sheet and call from s_hierarchy_traverse,
      which is called from s_traverse_sheet instead of s_hierarchy_traverse->
      s_hierarchy_traverse->s_hierarchy_traverse.

   ** src/s_hierarchy.c: Call s_traverse_hierarchy_sheet instead s_hierarchy_traverse
      as noted above. Release memory allocated by s_hierarchy_return_baseuref in
      s_hierarchy_remove_uref_mangling; pointed to by variable = new_uref.

   ** src/g_netlist.c: Revise function g_get_attribute_by_pinnumber:

          Reposition debug directives inside the if (return_value)

          Add "done = TRUE;" inside the preceeding if to ensure that
          o_attrib_search_object_attribs_by_name is not called twice.

          Add boolean return_pwr and set true instead of 'return_value = "pwr";'

          Edit conditional at exit to free return_value after setting scm_value

          set scm_return_value to "pwr" if return_pwr && not return_value

   ** src/s_netlist.c: Add local pointer "net_name" in s_netlist_post_process,
      make sure free pl_current->nets->next->net_name before over-writing the
      pointer with returned from s_net_name via net_name, add some DOxygen info.

   ** src/s_net.c: Revise s_net_name_search to allocate storage when assigning
      each pointer net_name rather than storing the same pointer, added notes
      in code regarding why this was done.

   ** src/s_rename.c: Release net_name before renaming in s_rename_all_lowlevel,
      added notes regarding freeing pointers to net names.

    * src/g_netlist.c: Revise function g_graphical_objs_in_net_with_attrib_get_attrib
      to not use scm_dynwind_free to release variable, instead explicitly release the
      memory using free() function, and locally scope pl_current, rename and locally
      scope wanted_net_name to current_name and remove conditional check for wanted_
      net_name since SCM_ASSERT scm_is_string would already handle this situation.

      Revise function g_get_all_unique_nets simlar to above; eliminate variable "list"
      and remove conditional check for wanted_net_name since SCM_ASSERT scm_is_string
      would already handle this situation. Eliminate variables "x" and "is_member".

      gspiceUI calls gnetlist in verbose mode. The debug-spew procedure output
      its data in the verbose mode to current-output-port using the display
      procedure and thus crippled netlists. Instead, it now uses the message

    * scheme/gnet*.scm: Revise all backends to use changes above, think I got
      most of the gnetlist: rerouted through gnetlist.scm and I think this is

2007-05-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* tests/spice-sdb/Makefile.am: Oops, because of the below disable,
	need to explicitly include run_tests.sh.  This needs to b undone
	once these tests pass make distcheck again.

2007-05-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* tests/spice-sdb/Makefile.am: Disabled spice-sdb tests
	temporarily since they break make distcheck.  Will re-enable
	once it is determined what is going wrong (for the next release).

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20070526 in prep for the next
        release.

2007-05-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/Makefile.am, gnet-osmond.scm: Added new gnetlist backend
	from John Doty. Thanks!

2007-04-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Moved the VHDL regression test into my private
	test target since it doesn't work for everybody (since some people
	do not install into $HOME/geda).

	* tests/spice-sdb/inputs/Makefile.am,
	tests/spice-sdb/inputs/sym/Makefile.am: Added missing test files
	to make distcheck happy again.

2007-04-28 (later) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* include/globals.h, scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm,
	src/globals.c, src/parsecmd.c  configure.ac: Add
	--nomunge flag to gnetlist, telling spice-sdb
	to not autocorrect incorrect device prefixes
	(handles complaint from John Doty).  Also
	upgraded handling of long opts.  Finally, updated
	spice-sdb test suite to check these new features.

2007-04-28 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* src/g_netlist.c, scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm:  Fix spice-sdb's
	treatment of slotted parts so it emits pins in pinseq order.
	This required making mods to g_netlist.c, as well as several
	fcns in libgeda.  Then updated spice-sdb test suite.  This
	closes bug 1680275.

2007-04-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gnetlist.c: Move the "-l" command line scheme loading code to
	be *before* schematics are loaded (instead of after).

	* examples/stack_1.sch, examples/Makefile.am: Added stack example
	schematic.

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/runtest.sh, tests/singlenet.protel,
	tests/singlenet.protelII, tests/stack.geda, tests/stack_1.geda,
	tests/drc2/Makefile.am, tests/hierarchy/Makefile.am,
	tests/hierarchy/gnetlistrc, tests/hierarchy/gnetlistrc.hierarchy:
	Fixed the gnetlist regressions tests to work with make distcheck.

	* tests/spice-sdb/run_tests.sh: Added -I "gnetlist -g" to the
	golden file diff to ignore the embedded command line information
	in the spice-sdb golden files.

	* scheme/gnet-calay.scm: Added backed written by John Doty for
	the Calay netlist. Thanks!

	* tests/runtest.sh: Minor improvements in test running script.

2007-04-21 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* tests/spice-sdb/*  Added new spice-sdb test directory.  Then
	created test environment similar to Dan's regression tests for
	refdes_renum.

2007-02-20 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* scheme/gnet-allegro.scm: Fix bug #1663729.
	  When writing the device files, check if 'devfiles' directory
	  exists and create it if needed.

2007-02-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* tests/multiequal.spice-sdb: Updated golden file to be current.

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/drc2/Makefile.am,
	tests/hierarchy/Makefile.am: Temporarily disabled make check to
	get past make distcheck.  The rules in make tests are probably
	missing a variable specifying the source of the input files.
	make check should enabled once we figure out what is missing.

	* tests/amp.spice-sdb, tests/darlington.spice-sdb: Updated golden
	files to be current.

2007-02-11 (later) Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm, scheme/gnetlist.scm: Changed
	string-pad-right to safe-string-head per suggestion from Jeff
	Mallatt.  Added safe-string-head to gnetlist.scm.

2007-02-11 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm: Incorporated patch from Jeff Mallatt
	enabling SPICE netlisting of slotted parts.

2007-02-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* docs/gnetlist.1, src/gnetlist.c, src/parsecmd.c: Applied patch by
	Tomaz Solc [ 1593644 ] gnetlist: use "-g help" to list available
	backends. Thanks!

	* tests/.cvsignore: Added rule to ignore all the newly generated
	files.

	* scheme/gnet-bom.scm, scheme/gnet-bom2.scm: Applied patch to
	change "package" to "refdes" [ 1656822 ] BOM/BOM2 should use
	refdes in title line

	* tests/hierarchy/hierarchy.geda: Updated golden file due to ordering
	of output changing.

	* src/globals.c: Removed quit_func since it is completely unused.

	* docs/gnetlist.1: Updated the man page a little for bug:
	[ 1556064 ] man page version out of date

	* tests/*.spice-sdb: Updated golden files to be current due to
	version number update.

	* configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20070216.

2007-02-10 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/drc2/Makefile.am,
	  tests/hierarchy/Makefile.am:
	  When running "make check", run "make tests" too.

        * tests/drc2/Makefile.am:
	  Added a pass/failed line after each test.

	* tests/drc2/.cvsignore: Added this new file.

	* configure.ac, tests/Makefile.am, tests/drc2/Makefile.am,
	  tests/drc2/*.sch, tests/drc2/*.drc2:
	  Added new regression test suite for the drc2 backend.

	* scheme/gnet-drc2.scm: Changed a (begin) to a (let ()) due to
	  guile 1.8 problems. Thanks to Stuart Brorson por reporting, and
	  Dean Ferreyra for pointing out the fix.

2007-02-08 19:24  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* configure.ac, scheme/Makefile.am, scheme/gnet-gsch2pcb.scm.in: 1)
	   add a new option to gsch2pcb "use-m4" for the project file or
	  "--use-m4" for the command line.  By default now, gsch2pcb will
	  not try to run m4 at all.  If you want the old behaviour of
	  running m4, you'll have to use this option.  It seems that this
	  is what most users want (no m4 involved at run time).

	  2) rather than hard coding a number of paths like /usr/X11R6/lib
	  and /usr/local/share into the code for places to look for PCB
	  footprints, use a single default directory which is based on
	  ${datadir}.  If the user wants to, they can override that with
	  --with-pcb-datadir=/opt/pcb-20070204/share for example.

	  3)  when searching for newlib footprints with, for example, a
	  name like footprint=MY1206, match either "MY1206" or "MY1206.fp"
	  so we can start having extensions on footprint files without
	  needing to explicitly add the ".fp" part in the footprint=
	  attribute.  All of the footprints in the pcb distribution which
	  came from the m4 libraries have .fp extensions now.

	  4)  add some example schematic files in the gsch2pcb example
	  directory

2007-01-15 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9./net>

	* scheme/gnet-bom.scm, scheme/gnet-bom2.scm: Added
	(use-modules (ice-9 rdelim)) fix guile-1.8 problem.

2007-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-switcap.scm: Added added (use-modules (ice-9 rdelim))
	to get read-line included and working.

2007-01-15 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9./net>
	* scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm: Changed escaping for parens to fix
	guile-1.8 bug.  Also added (use-modules (ice-9 rdelim)) to enable
	read-line.

2007-01-07 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9./net>
	* scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm: Added SPICE-NPN and SPICE-PNP
	to dispatch to cover cases where people had munged the transistor
	symbols.

2006-11-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Fixed libgeda detection/find error message when
        the wrong libgeda version is found. (Bug reported by Karel Kulhavy;

	from Peter Clifton.

2006-09-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated program version to 20060906.

	* src/gnetlist.c: Added CUSTOM_VERSION to all
	printfs/output/dialog boxes where VERSION is used so that it is
	easier to create custom version of gEDA/gaf.

2006-09-03 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* scheme/gnet-drc2.scm: Applied patch #1551415 from Tomas Solc.
	  Some part of an error message was written in standard output

	* tests/multiequal.spice-sdb: Updated golden file to take into
	account case change of .end

	* tests/amp.spice-sdb, tests/darlington.spice-sdb: Updated golden
	file to take into account case change of .end

2006-04-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/globals.h, include/prototype.h, src/g_netlist.c,
	  src/g_register.c, src/globals.c, s_netlist.c, s_traverse.c:
	  Build a netlist of graphical objects. This feature enables
	  using directives in the schematic.

        * scheme/gnet-drc2.scm:
	    - Added support for NoConnection and DontCheckPintypes directives.
	    - Changed the drc connection matrix. Now an unknown pin doesn't
              generate an error, and it can drive a net.
            - Added report for pins without the 'pintype' attribute.
	    - Display the pins when reporting a net with only one connection.

2006-04-11 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

2006-03-12 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* lib/system-gnetlistrc.in: Removed load for the system-gafrc file,
	since it is loaded by libgeda first.

2006-03-10 Stuart Brorson <sdb [AT] cloud9 [DOT] net>
	* scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm: Added "m" attribute to PMOS and NMOS
	transistors per request of Peter Kaiser.

2006-03-06 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/g_netlist.c: Return 'pwr' when getting pintype of a hidden
	pin. Thanks to Holger Oehm for providing the patch.

2006-03-03 Stuart Brorson <sdb [AT] cloud9 [DOT] net>
	* configure.ac, parsecmd.c: introduced getopt_long to enable
	parsing of long command line flags.  Had to change configure.ac
	to support looking for getopt.h instead of unistd.h.

2006-03-02 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* scheme/gnet-drc2.scm: Don't check pintypes of net "NoConnection".
	Thanks to Holger Oehm for reporting the bug and providing a patch.

2006-02-28 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* scheme/gnet-drc2.scm: Added netname in the output message
	when checking pintype connections.
	Thanks to Holger Oehm for providing the patch.

2006-02-05 Werner Hoch	<werner.ho@gmx.de>
	* scheme/gnet-spice.scm: cccs, ccvs, vccs and vcvs replacement uses
	a dash "-" in the name of vsens replacement, ngspice doesn't like that

2006-01-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* autogen.sh, m4/guile.m4, src/Makefile.am: Removed m4 files since
	they are installation specifc.  Also, all required libraries should be
	coming from LIBGEDA_LDFLAGS.

	* tests/*: Updated some of the spice regression tests to have the
	correct spice-sdb version

2006-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20060123

        * README: Updated for the new year and release.

2006-01-15 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
	* scheme/gnet-drc2.scm: Changed error message to be more
	self-explaining.

2006-01-07 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
	* scheme/gnet-drc2.scm: Added missing 'passive' in the
	pintype-full-names list, and changed the pintype error/warning
	message to something more self-explaining.

2006-01-07 Stuart Brorson <sdb AT cloud9 DOT net>
	*  configure.ac, src/Makefile.am:  Changed automake stuff
	to explicitly look for guile, and then link to it.

	*  autogen.sh, m4/guile.m4:  Added local guile macros.

2006-01-04 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
	*  src/g_netlist.c, src/s_net.c, scheme/gnet-drc2.scm
	scheme/gnetlist.scm, scheme/gnet-systemc.scm,
	scheme/gnet-vams.scm, scheme/gnet-verilog.scm
	scheme/gnet-vhdl.scm:  Modified code to emit
	"unconnected_pin-<number>" to fix bug noticed by John Doty.
	Besides modifying s_net.c to achieve this, I had to change
	the strcmp fcn in many files to a strncmp fcn to compare only
	the first 15 chars against "unconnected_pin".  Added strncmp?
	to scheme/gnetlist.scm to do this for Scheme backends.

	*  scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm:  Fix bug discovered by John Doty:
	spice-IO pins with refdes greater than P9 were sorted
	incorrectly (as strings).  Now they are sorted as numbers.

2005-12-28 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
	* src/g_netlist: Dereferenced return value of scm_c_module_lookup,
	which is passed to scm_sort_list_x.
	Fixed long standing bug that produces a "Wrong type argument in
	position 1: #<variable 8059240 binding: #<primitive-procedure <=>>"
	error when running gnetlist.
	Thanks to Neal Baer and James Cotton for the bug report, and also
	to Patrick Bernaud for the solution.

2005-11-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
	* src/globals.c: Added setting of load_newer_backup_func to NULL.
	It is needed now libgeda checks for autosave backup files when
	opening a schematic.

2005-09-27 18:44  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * configure.ac: check for strings.h for rindex

2005-09-27 18:43  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * src/s_hierarchy.c: remove various compiler warnings

2005-09-11 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * gnet-spice-sdb.scm: Incorporated patch from Paul Bunyk enabling
	netlisting of Josephson junctions and other magnetic devices.

2005-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped the package version to 20050820 which will be
        a real snapshot.

2005-08-16 22:54  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* configure.ac, scheme/Makefile.am, scheme/gnet-PCBboard.scm,
	  scheme/gnet-PCBboard.scm.in, scheme/gnet-gsch2pcb.scm,
	  scheme/gnet-gsch2pcb.scm.in: - use the M4 program discovered at
	  configure time as the default for m4 in the PCB backends.

	  - use the PCB directories from configure time as the defaults in
	  the PCB backends.  These can still be changed with
	  --with-pcbm4dir and --with-pcbconfdir.  As usual, they can be
	  changed at runtime with the gsch2pcb project file, but hopefully
	  this gets things nominally right by default.

2005-08-15 10:12  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* configure.ac: Search for a m4 to use.  Will be used by the pcb
	  netlisters.

2005-08-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gnetlist.c: Applied patch by Carlos Azevedo which moves the
	chdir after s_traverse since it might change the directory as well.

	* src/s_rename.c: Applied patch by Carlos Azevedo which
	re-implements the rename structures to be completely dynamic.

	* tests/*: Re-copied golden test files to be current with sdb
	version changes.

        * configure.ac: Updated package version to 20050814.  This is a
        temporary version and not a real release number.

	* scheme/gnet-gsch2pcb.scm: Oops accidentally removed an id tag.

2005-08-02 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-gsch2pcb.scm: Update to Bill Wilson's gsch2pcb version
	1.5.

2005-06-12 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
	* scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm: Changed order of writing out
	netlist and .model/.subckt cards to facilitate use of
	numparam with ngspice.

2005-05-16 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * include/globals.h, src/globals.c, src/parsecmd.c:
	Incorporated new -e command line flag which forces embedding
	of .include file's contents into SPICE netlist.

2005-05-16 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm: Modified so that .include
	doesn't embedd the included file's contents in the SPICE
	netlist by default.

2005-03-16 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm: fix typo in CCCS.  Now usage of
	Vsense is harmonized.

2005-03-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Removed all tests for gtk+ 1.2.x and fixed error
        message if gtk+ 2.2.x is not found.

2005-03-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20050313

2005-03-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gnetlist.c: Fixed code to allow user to specify absolute
	filenames on the command line again.

	* tests/*: Updated more golden regression files to take into
	account the package reordering changes.

2005-02-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* tests/*, examples/switcap/example.scn: Updated regression golden
	files to take into account the package reordering that has
	occurred because the various guile/gnetlist routines were either
	replaced or rewritten.	No netlist errors detected, just some
	of the packages were showing up in a different order in the various
	netlist formats.

2005-02-22  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* configure.ac, src/gnetlist.c: Removed call to gtk_init().
	  GDK is now initialized in libgeda if it's a non-graphical app.

2005-02-21 03:09  Dan McMahill <danmc>

	* src/gnetlist.c: fix some format string/type mismatch bugs

2005-02-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-spice.scm: Removed string by request from the original
	author.

2005-02-20  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/gnetlist.c (main_prog): Adapted for new logging system.

2005-02-19  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/globals.c: Added definition of picture_draw_func after
	adding picture support to libgeda.

	* configure.ac, src/gnetlist.c: Added call to gtk_init()
	  since gdk-pixbuf needs it if called.

2005-02-16 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* scheme/gnet-bom.scm, scheme/gnet-bom2.scm, scheme/gnet-redac.scm:
	  Use stdout if the output filename is "-".

2005-02-14  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/g_netlist.c (g_get_packages): Added two lines missing after
	yesterday rewrite.

2005-02-13  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/g_netlist.c (g_get_packages): Rewritten to use a GLib hash
	table instead of the libgeda s_scratch code.
	(g_get_non_unique_packages): Cleaned up.

2005-02-12 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gnetlist.c: Added a chdir back to the starting directory
	after all the rc files and schematics are loaded.  This is done
	so that the output files from gnetlist go into the expected
	directory instead of some other schematic directory.  This allows
	"make tests" in gnetlist/tests to work again.

	* src/gnetlist.c: Changed the size of the cwd directory to be
	MAXPATHLEN (the correct size).

2005-02-11 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* scheme/gnet-drc2.scm: Use stdout if the output filename is "-".
	  Updated documentation showing this behaviour.

2005-02-11  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/gnetlist.c (main_prog): Adapted for new toplevel and page APIs
	in libgeda.

2005-02-08 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* scheme/gnet-drc2.scm:
	  Use a parameter instead of the quiet mode of gnetlist so
          gnetlist doesn't return a non-zero value when there are only
	  warnings. This parameter is 'ignore-warnings-in-return-value'.

2005-02-08 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* include/globals.h, src/globals.c, src/g_netlist.c,
	  src/parsecmd.c, src/gnetlist.c:
	  Added '-O' option allowing to pass parameters to the backend.

2005-02-04 23:14  danmc

	* configure.ac, src/g_netlist.c, src/g_rc.c, src/g_register.c,
	  src/globals.c, src/gnetlist.c, src/i_vars.c, src/parsecmd.c,
	  src/s_cpinlist.c, src/s_hierarchy.c, src/s_misc.c, src/s_net.c,
	  src/s_netattrib.c, src/s_netlist.c, src/s_rename.c,
	  src/s_traverse.c, src/vams_misc.c, utils/mk_verilog_syms.c: add
	  support for Electric Fence debugging, enabled by --enable-efence,
	  and dmalloc debugging, enabled by --enable-dmalloc.  Both are off
	  by default.

2005-02-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/g_netlist.c, src/gnetlist.c, src/i_vars.c:
	* src/parsecmd.c, src/s_hierarchy.c, src/s_netattrib.c:
	* src/s_netlist.c, src/s_traverse.c: Replaced u_basic_strdup() and
	u_basic_strdup_multiple() by GLib functions.

	* src/gnetlist.c: Made it use GLib's G_DIR_SEPARATOR* instead of
	libgeda's *_SEPARATER_*.

2005-02-03 12:49  danmc

	* scheme/: gnet-PCB.scm, gnet-PCBboard.scm, gnet-allegro.scm,
	  gnet-bae.scm, gnet-bom.scm, gnet-bom2.scm, gnet-drc.scm,
	  gnet-drc2.scm, gnet-eagle.scm, gnet-geda.scm, gnet-gossip.scm,
	  gnet-gsch2pcb.scm, gnet-maxascii.scm, gnet-pads.scm,
	  gnet-partslist-common.scm, gnet-partslist1.scm,

	  gnet-systemc.scm, gnet-tango.scm, gnet-vams.scm,
	  gnet-verilog.scm, gnet-vhdl.scm, gnet-vipec.scm: add RCS Ids

2005-02-01  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/g_netlist.c: Switched to the new scm interface of guile.

2005-01-29  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

	* src/gnetlist.c (gnetlist_quit): Adapted for new component library
	code.

2005-01-28 Dan McMahill <dan at mcmahill dot net>

	* scheme/: gnet-futurenet2.scm, gnet-pads.scm, gnet-switcap.scm:
	  use the new gnetlist:build-refdes-aliases and
	  gnetlist:alias-refdes functionality to do a better job of
	  restricting reference designators in the output netlist to ones
	  which are valid for this netlist type.

2005-01-28 Dan McMahill <dan at mcmahill dot net>

	* scheme/gnetlist.scm: Add gnetlist:build-refdes-aliases,
	  gnetlist:alias-refdes, and gnetlist:unalias-refdes functions.
	  These are used to deal with target netlist refdes requirements
	  which may be more restrictive than gschem/gnetlist.  A backend
	  uses these by calling gnetlist:build-refdes-aliases at the
	  beginning of netlisting and then gnetlist:alias-refdes whenever
	  printing out the refdes.

	  While here add missing RCS Id.

2005-01-27 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* src/gnetlist.c: Changes made to enable correct opening
	of schematics in foreign directories.  Changes detailed in libgeda
	ChangeLog.

2005-01-23 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* scheme/gnet-drc2.scm: Added check for duplicated references.

2005-01-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_traverse.c: Added a output message if a component is missing
	its symbol file.

2005-01-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

	* src/g_register.c, src/g_netlist.c, include/prototype.h:
	Added function g_get_non_unique_packages so backends
	can get a non-unique list of packages. Useful for DRC checking.

	* src/g_netlist.c: g_get_slots and g_get_unique_slots functions:
	If a package has no slots attribute, then assume it's using slot 1.

	* src/gnetlist.c: Remind the user to check the schematic
	has no errors using drc2 backend.

        (above patch applied by Stuart Brorson)

2004-12-28 Stuart Brorson   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* lib/system-gnetlistrc: Changed to refer to system-gafrc instead
	of system-commonrc

	Jaume Masip

	* scheme/gnet-eagle.scm scripts/sch2eaglepos.sh docs/README.eagle:
	Added Eagle PCB scheme backend and cleanup script.   The backend
	and script were written by Braddock Gaskill.

	* docs/gnetlist.1: Added information on -s (from the usage of
	gnetlist)

	* tests/*.spice-sdb: Update various regression files with the new
	output from spice-sdb

2004-12-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20041228

2004-08-23 SDB   <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* Added fcns to pass the invoking command line to the Scheme backend
	as a string.  This allows the invoking command to be placed into
	a SPICE netlist in the first line.  Affected files:
	src/g_register.c, parsecmd.c, globals.c, g_netlist.c, gnetlist.c
	include/globals.h prototype.h

2004-08-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scripts/Makefile.am: Removed gschem2pcb from bin_SCRIPTS, as
	gsch2pcb is now the prefered tool.

2004-07-07 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm: Added Stuart's latest backend

	* tests/*: Updated some of the golden files to take into account
	version change string in new spice-sdb backend.

2004-07-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/i_vars.h, prototype.h, src/g_rc.c, g_register.c,

        * docs/Makefile.am: Changed doc install directory readme to readmes

2004-01-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-switcap.scm: Applied patch by Dan McMahill to use
	his new net aliasing (modification) code.

	* docs/gnetlist.1: Spent a little time updating the man page with
	at least the current list of backends and all the new command line
	flags.

	* tests/gnetlistrc.vhdl, tests/Makefile.am: Added vhdl only
	gnetlistrc.  This was required because the vhdl library was
	removed from system-commonrc, so this rc file has to put it back.
	The gnetlistrc.vhdl file is copied to gnetlistrc before any vhdl
	test is run and then the gnetlistrc file is removed.

2004-01-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * scheme/gnet-gsch2pcb.scm: Upgraded to Bill Wilson's latest
        version (1.2)

	to be current (take into the changes Dan's patches made to the
	PADS backend)

	* scheme/gnet-cascade.scm: Added new backend by Dan McMahill.  This
	backend is for driving RF Cascade (http://rfcascade.sourceforge.net)
	Thanks!

	* scheme/gnet-redac.scm: Added Racal Redac format backend by
	W. Kazubski.  This format is also used by Cadstar PCB software
	(at least up to version 4.30 for DOS  Thanks!

	* scripts/gschem2pcb: Applied a patch by Christopher K Eveland to
	fix a condition where gschem2pcb was picking up a pin when it
	should not.  I don't know if this fix is correct, but somebody
	will complain if it breaks gschem2pcb.  Thanks for the bug fix!

2004-01-01 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Added --with-docdir command line flag as well all
	the code to support installing documentation.  Also added a prog
	check for groff.

	* docs/Makefile.am: Added code to install all the readme files
	into the documentation directory.  Also added commands to
	generate an html version of the man page.  This html man page

	12.29.2003.c

	* tests/amp.spice-sdb, darlington.spice-sdb: Updated golden files
	to the new spice-sdb backend version (version and spaces at the end
	of certain lines).

	* tests/multiequal.sch, multiequal.spice-sdb: Added tests
	to make sure that attributes that have multiple equal signs netlist
	properly.

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20031231

2003-12-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-spice-sdb.scm, gnet-protelII.scm: Replaced with new
	versions from Stuart Brorson.  gnet-spice-sdb.scm has a version of
	12.29.2003.b

	* src/g_netlist.c: Integrated new file from Stuart.  This file
	improved some slot related error reporting and added
	"include_mode" to g_get_calling_flags().

	* src/globals.c, parsecmd.c, include/globals.h: Integrated changes
	from Stuart.  Added the -I command line flag.

	* scheme/gnetlist.scm: Integrated changes from Stuart.  This
	included a whole bunch of useful scheme functions for dealing with
	the command line.

	* tests/amp.spice-sdb, darlington.spice-sdb: Fixed regression
	golden files to deal with Stuart's new spice-sdb backend.

	* tests/powersupply.protelII, singlenet.protel: Fixed regression
	golden files to deal with Stuart's changes to the protelII backend.

2003-12-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Added checks for gtk+ 2.2.x and 1.2.x.  This was
        needed since the HAS_GTK22 will start to be used in libgeda includes.

2003-11-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* include/i_vars.h, src/g_rc.c, src/i_vars.c, src/g_register.c,
	include/prototype.h: Added unnamed-netname as a guile rc keyword.
	This will allow the "unnamed_net" string to be customized from
	the rc files.

	o_attribute_search_name_partial nonsense with the new scheme.

	  Patch and suggestion from Bruno Schwander.

2001-03-04  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-vhdl.scm: Integrate Thomas Heidel's VHDL bug fixes
	  (to generate better VHDL output)

	* configure.in: Updated version

	* configure.in: Added a check to make sure libgeda-config and
	  gesym-config are the right version

2001-03-01  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/*.c: Misc -Wall warnings cleaned up
	  Part of this cleanup found some warnings which could have lead
	  to core dumper bugs.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Fixed location of my test schematics

	* tests/amp_1.spice: Updated regression test to take into account
	  Bas' latest spice backend changes

2001-02-25  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_netattrib.c: Added some if (... == NULL) checks to prevent
	  some core dumps (original bug pointed out by Wolfgang Buesser)

	* scheme/gnet-spice.scm: Integrated Bas Gieltjes' latest changes
	  to his netlist backend

2001-02-23  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_hierarchy.c: Fixed the nasty bug which was caused by my
	  replacing the rc system to be like gschem.  Basically schematics
	  were being loaded so that there was only ONE copy in memory at
	  all times.  This is not how gnetlist works.  Each hierarchical
	  schematic must be uniq in memory.  Fixed it by changing
	  libgeda's s_hierarchy_down_schematic_single to take a normal
	  or force flag.

2001-02-17  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_traverse.c: Got all the traverse functions to use the new
	  connection system

	  changes

2001-01-30  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_traverse.c: Fixed the graphical=1 test so that the
	  outside of the component is also looked at for this attribute

2001-01-27  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_rename.c: Due to a bug in how the s_rename_* routines are
	  being used, you cannot get the renamed names, added code to properly
	  mux several sets of rename pairs.

	* src/s_hierarchy.c: Changed the s_rename_destroy to use
	  s_rename_next_set (instead of destroying, go to the next set)

	* src/gnetlist.c: Changed s_rename_destroy to s_rename_destroy_all

	* tests/netattrib_1*: Added a test schematic and valid netlist to
	  the tests

2001-01-26  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_net.c, s_rename.c: More work on getting the rename of two
	  same named nets working.

2001-01-25  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_net.c: Added some code which will rename nets which are
	  named twice.  This code needs to be examined again to make sure
	  this is the right way of doing this.

2001-01-17  Stefan Petersen  <spe@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-bom.scm, scheme/gnet-bom2.scm: Improved the
	  parseconfig procedure. More stable(?) and more PC.

2001-01-15  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_cpinlist.c: Fixed core dumper when pin doesn't have
	  the required pin#=# attributed. (Pointed out by Matt, fixed by
	  Stefan)

2000-12-22  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-vams.scm: Fixed a minor bug which was uncovered by
	  Stefan's stricter error checking in g_netlist.c

2000-12-14  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* tests/*: removed some tests since they put version information
	  into the files which caues the tests to fail.

	* tests/*: Added some more very simple tests (using singlenet_1.sch)

2000-12-17  Stefan Petersen  <spe@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gnetlist.c: Changed the repl to Guile built in one. Better
	  error handling, work like Guile and so on.

	* src/g_netlist.c, src/vams_misc.c: Added inparameter check on all
	  Guile routines (SCM_ASSERT(...)).

2000-12-14  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* examples/vams/*: Misc updates to the example files

	* docs/gnetlist.txt: Moved file into docs directory

	* src/s_hierarchy.c: Fixed a minor bug in hierarchy-uref-order and
	  prepend mode: had to unmangle names using this flag as a parameter
	  (so that the right uref basename was used).

2000-11-03  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gnetlist.1: Updated manual with all the various backend formats

2000-11-02  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_netlist.c: Added another call to a post process routine
	  (the routine to remove the uref mangling if that's enabled via
	   rc keyword)

	* src/s_hierarchy.c: Added s_hierarchy_remove_uref_mangling

	* src/s_hierarchy.c: Got hierarchy_uref_rename working right.

	* src/*.c: Wrote the code to use the above new keywords

	* src/g_rc.c: Finally migrated a change from the gschem/src/g_rc.c
	  which fixes a core dump if you mess up a value for a keyword.
	  (pass true size of the lookup table in RETURN_G_RC_MODE)

	* src/s_hierarchy.c: Put some verbose print in for the uref
	  demangling code

2000-11-02  Stefan Petersen  <spe@geda.seul.org>

	  so had to change all instances to pass this pointer in

2000-10-31  Stefan Petersen  <spe@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnetlist.scm: Cleaned up and renamed split
	  gnetlist:wrap.

	* scheme/gnet-PCB.scm: Now PCB-backend uses wrap function
	  above. Was reported as a bug by Russ Dill.

2000-10-29  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_netattrib.c: Got net= attribute to use the hierarchy tag
	  when a net= is found in some underlying schematic.

	* src/s_hierarchy.c: Created s_hierarchy_create_name which creates
	  properly structured hierarchy named things

	  names are created now use above new function

2000-10-23  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	  you have more than one level of hierarchy)

	* src/s_rename.c: Ran file through indent

2000-10-22  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gnetlist.c: Removed extra compare to f_open calls so it
	  works with the changes Stefan made in libgeda

	* src/create_proto: Updated it the the latest version

	* src/s_traverse.c: Removed a lot of redundant code (made possible
	  by the recent libgeda structure changes)

	  for hierarchy support

	* src/*.c: Extensive work to get hierarchy support, modified almost
	  every file

	  compiling.

2000-10-10  Stefan Petersen  <spe@geda.seul.org>

	* src/gnetlist.c: Honours the error code returned from f_open
	  from now on and tells invoker it didn't find the file.

2000-10-07  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.in: Removed an old GTK+ test which is no longer used

2000-10-06  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_traverse.c: Changed the code which reports if a uref is
	  missing or not.  Should be a little better, but might falsely
	  report missing urefs

        * src/gnetlist.c: Changed CYGWIN32 warning message

2000-10-04  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_net.c: Fixed a lame error message to be a little more
	  descripting (when you forget uref or pin number attributes)

2000-08-21  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/*.c: Got gnetlist to build with all the libgeda modifications

	  have applied the 20000704a patch correctly.

2000-07-05  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-bae.scm, scheme/gnet-pads.scm, scheme/gnet-protelII.scm:
	  These files still referenced the "physical" attribute, when instead
	  it should be "footprint"

	* src/s_traverse.c: Because of my overloading of the "label=" attribute
	  it was possible for a pin to supply a label to net, which is a big
	  no-no (bug). Fixed by checking to make sure object is not a pin.

2000-07-04  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/*.c: Updated copyright info in each file

        * src/*.c: Changed all GNU to GPL in the appropriate places

2000-06-01  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/s_project.c: Added init of some important variables which
	  libgeda uses when promoting attributes.  The attribute promotion
	  code is almost completely disabled through these defaults

          Mike's header addition

	* scheme/gnet-verilog.scm: Added a missing newline in netlist header

2000-04-26  Stefan Petersen  <spe@geda.seul.org>

	  Bartels Autoengineer) to the ever increasing list of contributed
	  backends for gnetlist. Contributed by Rolf Fiedler
	  <Rolf.Fiedler@Ferrari.DE>

2000-04-21  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

          Bardsley

2000-04-15  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* src/g_netlist.c: Added g_get_pin_attribute which given a uref,
	  a pin number, and a wanted attribute returns the value.

	* src/create_proto: Updated prototype.h creation script to use gtk/glib
	  paths from my machine (installed in /usr/local ...)

	* src/g_register.c: Added entry for g_get_pin_attribute

          Thanks to njh for pointing this out.

2000-02-07  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-spice.scm: Updated file with Bas' patch to allow the
	  use of the uref=include... mechanism, see for more info:
	  http://www.geda.seul.org/mailinglist/geda-dev25/msg00113.html

2000-02-04  Stefan Petersen  <spe@geda.seul.org>

	* scheme/gnet-PCBboard.scm: Fixed (hopefully) guile version
	  incompatibilities in module popen (didn't exist before 1.3.2)

2000-01-25  Matt Ettus   <matt@ettus.com>

	* scheme/gnet-PCBboard.scm:  Added JM's code

1999-10-04  Magnus Danielson  <cfmd@swipnet.se>

	* scheme/gnet-vhdl.scm: Finally fixed the write-port-clause stuff.
	This is now splitted into three routines which forms a much better
	basis for further development and also fixes the bugs which occurs if
	any or more of the in, out and inout sublists happends to be empty.
	Stuck in support for signal type.

1999-10-03  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * In all *.c included define.h before struct.h

1999-09-28  Magnus Danielson  <cfmd@swipnet.se>

	* scheme/gnet-vhdl.scm: Fixed bug with no ports to entity.

9/25/99	Integrated Magnus's latest VHDL backend .scm code

9/23/99	Split up gnetlist.scm into seperate files.  The basic functions will
	live gnetlist.scm while the individual backends will be in gnet-*.scm

	Made some changes to the code so that the right backend *.scm code
	is loaded when appropriate

	Integrated Magnus Danielson's VHDL backend

9/19/99	Make sure gnetlist runs with guile-1.3.2a

	Fixed all warnings

9/17/99	Fixed that really nasty bug/problem that dealt with loading up
	multiple sheets (see below).  The postprocess was happening too
	early and was for some odd reason nuking previously post processed
	nets.

9/16/99	Finally integrated Bas Gieltjes's latest spice netlist (sorry about
	the delay)  (this basically consisted of adding the code to
	gnetlist.scm)  I'm not 100% this still works with the current
	gnetlist, especially the new net= attribute

	Added code in gnetlist.c to only load up schematics which haven't
	been loaded already

	Found a NASTY bug/problem when you try to load up more than one
	schematic sheet with gnetlist.  Added a line in s_traverse_start
	which should have helped, but problem/bug still exists

9/14/99 Integrated Matt Ettus's Allegro and PCB gnetlist backends.  Thanks!

	Updated man page to reflect the backends

9/12/99	Fixed a netlist print function to that it doesn't try to print
	valid null strings

	Fixed up s_net_name_search so that it tells the user if a multiple
	named net is found

	Implemented the concept of net name priority (net_name_has_priority)
	which controls which name has the highest priority.

	Added net-naming-priority keyword which controls which attribute
	(either net= or label= ) has priority when both are attached to a net

	Added i_vars.c which containes the rc mode init funcs which are
	used by Kazu's rc mode functions

	More work on getting net= attribute to override previously defined
	pins (all controlled through net-naming-priority)

	Removed some obsolete #if 0'd out code from s_net.c

	Added s_rename.c which contains all the code to handle the renaming
	(aliasing) of net names.

	Integrated s_rename functions into the code

	Fixed a bug in s_netattrib_net_search where the outside of the
	component wasn't being search for overriding net= attributes

	Fixed s_netlist_post_process, (the net naming), to only name
	nets of components which have a uref.  Components which don't
	have a uref are power/gnd/special components

	Updated verbose legend to include the R (rename of nets)

	Added gnetlist:get-renamed-nets which takes a dummy parameter and
	returns a list of lists (which contain src -> destination net
	renaming pairs)

	Updated the geda netlist backend to output the above renaming
	list pairs into the netlist file as a new section

9/11/99	Created s_netattrib.c which contains all the code to handle the net=
	attribute

9/7/99	Start work on getting the net= attribute to work

9/5/99	Moved test_verilog.sch into the examples directory (from
	gschem/examples)

9/3/99	Fixed a nasty stupid bug in the nethash datastructure creation,
	used a constant instead of the pound define

8/31/99	Renamed ntext to text (finally)

	Fixed g_rc.c to work on WinNT

8/30/99	Renamed all ales to conn and ALES to CONN

8/27/99	Set the program version to 19990829 to force Ales to release
	on the 29th :)

	Updated all *.c and *.h files to have the right address for the
	FSF in the copyright/licence header

8/19/99 Updated Matt Ettus's BOM backend with thi's formatting changes

8/17/99	Added some bus related globals.

8/11/99	Added the real code to implement gnetlist:get-toplevel-attribute

	Integrated Matt Ettus's bill of material code (cool stuff!)

8/8/99 	Moved mk_verilog_syms to utils (created utils and Makefile.am)

	Minor updates to example schematics since I renamed some of the
	verilog symbols to have the -1 prefix.

8/5/99	Added some stuff to configure.in for win32 builds

8/3/99	Updated libtool to 1.3.3

	Integrated Mike Jarabek latest verilog backend
		- Patched g_netlist.c
		- Patched g_register.c
		- Patched gnetlist.scm
		- Added examples/sch/*.sch to examples
		- Added mk_verilog_syms to src
		- Added symbols to ../symbols

8/2/99	Added g_netlist_get_attribute, which allows you go find any toplevel
	attributes (not yet functional)

7/21/99 Removed all trace of s_passing.h

7/15/99	Added support for libgdgeda 1.6 (mainly means searching for libpng)

7/6/99  Changed configure and Makefiles to cut down on the number of
	libraries which are linked

	Didn't really disable libgdgeda when using --disable-gdgeda
        Now fixed.

7/5/99 	Verified that gnetlist works with alphanumeric slotting

	Fixed all warnings

	Renamed s_netlist_post_resolve to s_netlist_post_process

	Put Manu's configure.in changes into gnetlist as well

	Got configure.in to be almost identical to gnetlist/configure.in

	Updated man page slightly

7/4/99 	Integrated latest verilog backend from Mike

	Changed Mike's all-nets function to use get-all-unique-nets
	(equate same named nets together)

	Added some improved feedback when doing the net traversal with
	verbose mode on

7/3/99	Removed almost all executing traces of connected_to_[1|2] (these
	was replaced by connected_to)

	Added gnetlist:get-all-unique-nets which returns all the unique
	nets in the design

	Added gnetlist:get-all-connections which returns all connections
	which are associated with the argument netname

	Worked on gnetlist.scm to use above functions.

	Got geda netlist format to use above functions correctly.

	Got tango netlist format to use above functions correctly.
	(all others are okay)

	Reformated the tango backend scheme code to be more scheme like
	Reformated the gEDA backend scheme code to be more scheme like

	Went through all the code removing old obsolete variables from
	the internal representation.

	As of the today gnetlisting works again :-)

7/2/99  Fixed the ./configure stuff dealing with libgdgeda so that it works
        when libgdgeda isn't installed in a system directory

7/1/99 	Got support for gdgeda in configure.in (required because you
	are linking against libgeda)

6/29/99 Got the core of nethash working with the rest of gnetlist

	Things seem to be working better now.  Core traversal of nets
	works now as well as the naming of nets.

6/25/99 Added support to configure to look for optarg and friends otherwise
        include the right externs...

6/17/99 Finally put all the changes in to make gnetlist work with the
	new connection system

6/8/99	Integrated old gnetlist into the current development dist scheme


--------------- new devel stuff starts here ----------------------------


5/14/99 Updated manual page a bit

5/13/99 Integrated Mike Jarabek's verilog netlister

4/11/99	Added some more debugging information when reading in the scm file

4/9/99	Fixed Makefile.am so that gnetlist.1 is installed

3/26/99 Added some newlines in a few places in gnetlist.scm

3/20/99 Got spice backend guile functions to follow the new
	backend:function_name naming convention

3/19/99	Updated g_rc to print more diag message to the log file when
	it can't find an rc file (like gschem)

3/18/99 Updated g_rc to use new macros for finding system-*rc files

3/11/99 Added back the original implementation of the write-net-name-...
	guile code for the spice netlist.  It works right for transistors.
	Mine did not.  Bummer.  Spice netlist doesn't support slotting for
	now.

3/10/99	Fixed a coredump when you pass in an "unknown" for the pin number
	in get-nets.  Return a list which is ("ERROR"). (pointed out by
	Bas Gieltjes)

	Changed ales-netlist format to geda-netlist format.  Changed
	gnetlist.scm appropriately

	Renamed all C guile functions to be called gnetlist:<whatever>
	This makes it clear where functions come from

	Added code to set netlist_mode which enables/disables certain
	netlist features.  Each backend should call this with something
	even if it's the default mode: gEDA

	Added gnetlist:set-netlist-mode to g_register and g_netlist which
	sets the above mode

	Integrated tango netlist backend by Nuno Sucena (thanks)

	Changed the highest level function in all backends to take a
	parameter which is the netlist output filename.  This is a required
	parameter

	Added -o flag which specifies output filename (for above), if you
	don't specify an output filename the default is output.net

	Integrated spice backend by Bas Gieltjes

	Had to add a kludge to gnetlist.c which sets netlist_mode based
	on the guile_proc string (for spice mode which needs to be set
	before the .sch files are read in)

	Changed the default unnamed_counter to be one instead of zero

	Fixed the incorrect behavior when you have slotted components and
	the spice backend.

	Played a bit with the way power connections show up in the netlists
	(s_net.c and the POWER string code)  Not completely happy with
	any of this.

3/9/99	Fixed a few variables which were uninitialized (width, height,
	snap_size)

1/24/99 Removed some // comments (shouldn't use those in C code)

12/3/98 Added thi's small gnetlist patch

11/8/98	Changed the ales-netlist slightly (less newlines)

	Started adding code to resolve same net names

	Found a really nasty bug, wasn't initalizing net_name in cpinlist!

	Found several really nasty bugs, where something was initalized
	incorrectly (strings = 0 ?!?) (s_net.c in add function)

	Found another missing init (object_ptr) in s_netlist.c (add function)

	Found another missing init (original) in s_cpinlist.c (add function)

	All of the above bugs were apparently the cause of the mysterious
	guile 1.3 problem.  Further testing is needed

10/25/98 Cleaned up all warnings

10/24/98 Discovered that gnetlist doesn't like guile 1.3

	 Fixed a memory overrite in s_net_name, also added a return(NULL)

	 Fixed a place where I was freeing a null pointer in g_get_packages

	 Found/fixed another "trying to free null data"

 	 Updated gnetlist.scm with display-connections (output.net looks
	 better)

10/20/98 Fixed a bug which prevented gnetlist to work with guile 1.3

	 Change rc file guile primative version to gnetlist-version

10/18/98 Changed o_attrib_search_name_single to pass a null in for the last
	 argument

10/12/98 Added guile code to handle unconnected pins (gnetlist.scm)

	 Found a place where U? wasn't being set.

10/11/98 Added parsecmd.c (commandline argument parsing)

         Simplified the loading of schematic sheets and intergrated above

	 Added the actual command line options (-v for verbose mode) and
	 (-i for guile interactive mode)  Default for both of these is
	 off

	 Added usage() function (which exits when called)

	 Added quiet_mode to the command line arguments, to shut off all
	 messages

	 Removed all warnings

	 Worked on gnetlist.scm to get some guile code to drive some of
	 the new netlist code

	 Added and registered g_get_package_attribute guile function which
	 returns the wanted attribute from the specified package uref

	 Added command line option -g guile_proc so you can execute guile
	 scripts from the command line

	 Added code to support above

	 More work into gnetlist.scm to get some sort of netlist writer
	 going


10/10/98 Added file s_traverse.c which creates flat netlist datastructure

	 Serious work on getting netlist code to work!

	 Add s_net.c (functions that deal with the net structure)

	 Add s_netlist.c (functions that deal with the netlist struct)

	 Add s_cpinlist.c (functions that deal with the cpinlist struct)

	 Completely preliminary code for netlist generation (first cut,
	 highly inefficient, but works! :)

	 Updated g_get_packages to use the new available structures (much
	 faster)

	 Updated g_get_pins to use the new available structures (much
	 faster)

	 Added (exit) and (quit) guile functions

	 Found a condition where my attempt to speed up the netlist post
	 processing, but it found a nasty bug, so now we have a 3 pass
	 post process.
