; gnetlist-version string
;
; Specifies the version of this file.  This number is used to make sure
; that the rc file is compatible with the version of gschem that is
; being run. The end user should *not* change this value. This should
; not be confused with the gnetlist:get-version scheme API function
; that returns the gnetlist dotted version string.

; net-naming-priority string
;
; Specifies which netname has priority if a net is found with two names.
; If this variable is set to "netattrib" then any netname specified with the
; net= attribute is used as the netname. Likewise if this variable is set to
; "netname" then any netname conflict is resolved using the netname= value.

; hierarchy-uref-mangle string
;
; Controls if uref names are mangled to make them unique when traversing down
; into the hierarchy. If this options is disabled then reference designators
; are not changed. Reference designators MUST be unique throughout the entire

; hierarchy-netname-mangle string
;
; Controls if net names are mangled to make them unique when traversing
; down into the hierarchy.  If this is disabled then the net names are not
; changed and it is the user's responsibility to make sure they are unique.
; This basically has the effect of making all same named nets in the entire
; hierarchy be electrically connected. It is recommeneded that this option
; not be disabled. This option is provided for advanced user.

;
; Controls if net created by using the net= attribute are renamed to make

; then the net= created nets are not changed. This feature is handy to have
; global nets which spawn the entire hierarchy (like power or ground nets).
; Make sure you know what you are doing if you disable this option.

; hierarchy-uref-separator string
;
; Specifies what the separator string between the various hierarchy tags
; for all urefs.  This string can also be "" (empty) to specify that no
; chars should be used.  This keyword is ignored if hierarchy-uref-mangle
; is disabled (though a default "/" is used in this case, and then all the
; internal mangling is removed so it is not seen by the user). This keyword
; is used in conjunction with the respective hierarchy-*-order keyword.

; is ignored if hierarchy-netname-mangle is disabled.  This keyword
; is used in conjunction with the respective hierarchy-*-order keyword.

; This keyword is also fairly coupled with hierarchy-uref-separator and
; hierarchy-netattrib-separator so you will probably have to change those
; to get the wanted hierarchy naming.

; world-size width height border
;
; Specifies the size of the world and a border
; Be sure all inputs are reals (floats/doubles) and don't try to reverse
; the values: to get a portrait mode.  Code to support that needs to be added
; The code that implements this automatically transforms the dimensions into
; the proper aspect ratio.  All units are in inches.
; This is not the paper size.  That is specified elsewhere. End users should
