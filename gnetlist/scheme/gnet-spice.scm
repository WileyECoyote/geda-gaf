;;  Two types of model can be included:
;;  1.  An embedded model, which is a one- or multi-line string held in the attribute "model".
;;      In this case, the following attributes are mandatory:
;;      --  model (i.e. list of parameter=value strings)
;;      --  model-name
;;      --  type
;;      In this case, the function creates and formats the correct spice model line(s).
;;  2.  A model held in a file whose name is held in the attribute "file"
;;      In this case, the following attribute are mandatory:
;;      --  file (i.e. list of parameter=value strings)
;;      In this case, the function just opens the file and dumps the contents
;;      into the netlist.
