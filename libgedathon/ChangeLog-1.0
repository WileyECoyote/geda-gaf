    * tests/run_tests.sh: Implement function do_setup_geda_environment in
      order for libraries to locate the source symbol tree. Replace brackets
      with more Bourne like syntax while attempting to replace Bash but was
      unable to get sh to use redirection of tails as inputs to diff so leave

2016-01-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * tests/run_tests.sh: Revised test to skip the first line, the file
      version, when comparing the reference to the output.

    * libgedathon/module/geda.c: Revise comments.

      checker and do_export_path2libraries along with variables to locate
      built libraries and gsymcheck. New scheme utilizes LD_LIBRARY_PATH to

      tests to be performed in the source using built binaries.

2015-11-15  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * tests/lpfilter.sch: Regenerate would be "golden" output.

2015-10-31  Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/libgedathon.c: Revise PyGeda_is_page_modified to set status
      using geda_page_get_changed, which would be -1 if the page is
      invalid.

    * docs/gsym-set-visibility.1.in

2015-03-17 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * scripts/gsym-attribute.py: Bump version from 0.2 to 0.2.2, Change -u
      --value option to -l, added -q, --quite options with function QMessage
      and implemented in code. Removed string of dashes from VMessages, did
      not look good. Add member ExitCode to Options container and set when
      an attribute whose value was requested was not found in the symbol.
      Fixed page.filename(), the member was rename as name so getter could
      be accessed with page.filename.

    * docs/gsym-attribute.1.in: Update options

2015-03-09 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * scripts/geda-snap-grid.py: Respin gsym-snap-grip; Make more generalize
      and improve robustness and rename file. geda-snap-grid can now be used
      to process schematic file not just symbols.

2015-03-09 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * Extend Python API: Rename Page, Save Page As, Get Page Changed

    * src/libgedathon.c: Add function PyGeda_is_page_modified to provide an
      API to get the current status of the page, function PyGeda_rename_page
      to provide an API to change the page file name without saving the file
      and PyGeda_save_as_page to provide an API to save the file using a new
      filename.

    * module/geda.c: Add macro TYPE_INT_I1C1, kind of defeats the purpose
      because seems like every API is using unique argument format. Add
      method is_page_modified to get the page status, add rename_page,
      aka do_rename_page, to provide API to change the page file name,
      and save_as_page to provide an API to save the file using a new
      filename.

    * module/objects/geda_py_page.c: Change member "filename" to "name" to
      fix conflict with the setter method. Revise newly acessible setter
      PyGeda_rename_page to call module method "rename_page". Set the
      new modified flag if the file name is changed.

2015-03-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/libgedathon.c: Updated order of arguments for o_attrib_attach

      english instead of giberish.

2015-02-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * scripts/gsym-snap-grid.py: New utility script rounds attribute X-Y location
      to align with a grid, default to multiples of 25 but can be specified as a
      command-line argument. Using libgeda for this might be little over-kill but
      script could potentially be expanded with additional features like setting
      alignments and this would be easier using library. (I should have created
      this along time ago, many hours lost cleaning symbol files and even those
      will need to be re-screened with the new utility.

2015-02-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * scripts/gsym-attribute.py: Add version variable and command-line option, minor
      revisions to help string.

      GEDA_IS_OBJECT(object) was missing outer parentheses, but gcc was
      accepting.

    * src/update_objects.c: Same thing! Add parentheses in function
      PyGeda_update_complex_butes, most likely copy and paste, again
      gcc was accepting.

2014-10-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/libgedathon.c: Set net_name to empty strings if NULL in function

      The setter in only functional within Ligedathon because Libgeda
      does not currently have the functionality to "set" the string
      with out recreating the path object. Needs more work setter, but
      getter is fully functional.

2014-10-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * module/objects/geda_py_line.c: A member struct with just one
      member (for now) to PyGedaLine object, the member is length, which

        * docs/libgedathon.dox: Generate TAGFILES files for libgedathon
          in the output directory. Redirect errors and warnings to log.

2014-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * tests/run_tests.sh: Improve unit-test for Libgedathon.
          unit test now checks each of the three symbols files
          created for insertion into lpbf.sch for compliance using
          gsymcheck.

2014-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/libgedathon.c: Uncommented s_object_add for children in
          PyGeda_add_object, don't remember why I did that, but was bug.
          Attributes added to floating pin objects were not being added
          to the object when the pin was commited to the page. Fixed Now.
          Did not affect pins whose attributes were added after the pin
          was committed to the page. Add in source comments and additional
          information in README.txt regarding being root.

2014-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * module/geda.c: Revised module function new_pin, to accept either
          a string or an integer for the pin number argument using Python
          functions (sense the module does not have access to Libgeda).
          Previous commits changed the 6th argument from integer to type
          string. Now can be either and I think this is more convenient.
          This does however, makes new_pin unique in that it is the only
          module API function that derives a Python argument, other than
          the PyColor arguments, (not currently implemented).

2014-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * docs/guide-libgedathon.html: Fixed numerous grammatical errors in
          documentation, minor rephrasing to improved clarity or conciseness.

        * *: Redo entire API library and modules allow pins number
          as string, rather than integers, in libgeda.

2014-07-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/*/*.c: Redo inclusion of header files

2014-07-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * /src/libgedathon.c: Replace mkdir with f_create_path in function
          PyGeda_open_page and modified error message to include reason path
          creation failed. Not changing library revision because the change
          is insignificant.

2014-07-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * *: More work on Doxygen documentation; Changed group delimiters to
          use a different style than function documentation, add and end group
          use the double asterisk, as oppose to the asterisk exclamation pair
          so as to allow independent indexing and while searching documentation
          comments.

2014-07-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

	*: Redu .gitignore files

2010-10-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>
