.SH NAME
geda-snap-grid \- A gEDA-gaf Schematics and Symbol cleaning utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B geda-snap-grid
.RI  [ INFORMATION ] | [ OPTIONS ] [ DIRECTIVES ] [INPUT] [OUTPUT]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Round X-Y coordinates of attributes in schematic and symbol files to multibles
of 25 or a specified value.

By default, geda-snap-grid operates on both schematic and symbol files
unless file names are specified on the command line, either with the
--input <inputfile> option or just listing the files. For both schematic
and symbol files, the extension must be specified when files names are
specified.

.SH QUICK
.B usage: [Options] -i <inputfile> [[-o] <outputfile> ] [list of files]

Example: Snap all attribute coordinates values in all files in the current
         directory and in all subdirectories to the nearest multiple of 50
         and report modified values:

    geda-snap-grid.py --verbose -R -m 50

Example: Snap all attribute coordinates values in schematic files in the current
         directory appending "sym" and "sht" to the library search path rounding
         up to a multiple of 25:

    geda-snap-grid.py -a sht --sch

Example: Snap all attribute coordinates values in the file Motor_Control_sht_2.sch
         up to a multiple of 25 and save the file to Motor_Control_sht_2.fixed.sch,
         appending "sym" to the library search path if "./sym/" exist:

    geda-snap-grid -u -i Motor_Control_sht_2.sch -o Motor_Control_sht_2.fixed.sch

.SH INFORMATION
Use of the following options displays information related to geda-snap-grid
but does not inspect or alter any symbol files:
.IP "-h, --help"
Show information about the advanced usage of this command.
.IP "--usage"
Displays basic usage of this command.
.IP "-V, --version"
Displays software version information.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be used to modify the default behavior of geda-snap-grid

.IP "-d, --down"
"Force rounding down, the default is to round to nearest multible of moduli.
.IP "-u, --up"
Force rounding up, the default is to round to nearest multible of moduli.
.IP "-m #"
Round to moduli specified by #, default is 25.
.IP "-x"
Only round X coordinates, mutually exclusive with -y
.IP "-y"
Only round Y coordinates, mutually exclusive with -x

.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Enable verbose mode. Displays additional information about what the program is doing.
.IP "-R, --Recursive"
Process all symbol files in the current and all subordinated directories.
.IP "-a, --append <path>"
When processing schematic files this option can be used to specify addition directories to
be appended to the libraries search path. This option is not needed for directories with
the name "sym", if such a directory exist, the directory will be appended automatically.
.IP "-n, --no-path"
By default, if a directory exist with the name "sym", then the directory is appended to
the library search path when processing schematic files, this option inhibits that behavior.
This option is provided for advanced users and should not normally be used.
.IP "-c, --sch"
Directs geda-snap-grid to only process schematic files. This directive is ignored if a
file name or names are specified on the command line.
.IP "-s, --sym"
Directs geda-snap-grid to only process symbol files. This directive is ignored if a file
name or names are specified on the command line.
.IP "-i, --input <input file>"
Specify the name of the input file. Wild cards are accepted, the default is *.sym + *.sch.
.IP "-o, --output <output file>"
Specifies the name of the output file. When the output file name is not specified the input
file will be over written
