  Inclusion of the geda module.
  <p/>
  By default the geda module is installed to the local Python module directory. On Linux machines this might be something
  like "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/geda". To import the module, the module must be located within the search
  path of the interpreter. If the module was installed to a non-standard location, such as dist-packages, the importer
  might not find the geda module. The Python search path can be set using various methods. A common method is to use
  the environment variable PYTHONPATH, which may contain a colon-separated list of directories. The PYTHONPATH variable
  can be appended using something like:

	<dd>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:THE/PATH/TO/GEDA</dd>
  <br />
  Other methods can be used to modify the Python search path, such as using sys.path.append('/path/to/search') or
  site.addsitedir. See the Python documentation for more information on using such methods.

  <p/>
  To include the geda module use:
  <br />
	<dd><code>from geda import geda</code></dd>
  <p/>
  The high level functions can be imported using:
  <br />
  	<dd><code>from geda.functions import *</code></dd>
  <p/>
  The high level functions provide an interface to the base module with minimal type checking and no defaulting. The
  base module provides defaults for all optional parameters.
  <p/>
  It is also convenience to include all of the constants separately with:
  <br />
	<dd><code>from geda.constants import *</code></dd>
	<br />
  <p/>
  It is not required to directly import the high level functions and constants separately, but doing so is more
  convenience. Submodules could be referenced using statements like:
  <br />
  <dd><code>geda.functions.AddCapacitor(schematic, 6700, 8600, "20nF")</code></dd>
	 or<br />
	<dd><code>sheet1 = geda.constants.SHOW_NAME_VALUE</code></dd>
	 or even<br />
	<dd><code>sheet1 = geda.SHOW_NAME_VALUE</code></dd>
  <p/>
