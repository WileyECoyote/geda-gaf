  Using the geda module.
  <p/>
  Libgedathon is automatically initialized by the geda module when the module is imported. All functions
  and methods are available immediately. LibgEDA is initialized by Libgedathon, including the processing of the
  system-gafrc file. There are no Python specific configuration files. While LibgEDA is a shared static library,
  Libgedathon is dynamically linked, even on Linux machines. The full symbol library will be available from
  the installed library path. This path is append-able using the Libgedathon API. There are also utility
  functions to create local "gafrc" files, which are typically used to append the library search path.
  <p/>
  In general, programs will start either by opening existing files, schematic or symbols, or creating new
  files. As a quick example, these operations could be performed using:
  <br />
	<dd><code>schematic = geda.new_page(filename)</code></dd>
	 or<br />
	<dd><code>sheet1 = geda.open_page(path + "sheet1")</code></dd>
  <p/>
  The returned objects represent the page. This object must be supplied to most methods, such as all methods in the
  Creation group. Libgedathon does not currently support the "current page" scheme supported by LibgEDA. With
  Libgedathon the page must always be specified.
  <p/>
  Pages should be saved before closing using either a module level function or the page object's methods. Using the page
  names from the preceding example, the page could be saved and closed using either of these methods:
  <br />
	<dd><code>geda.save_page(schematic)</code></dd>
	  or<br />
	<dd><code>sheet1.save()</code></dd>
  <p/>
	Files can also be saved when closing by supplying an optional integer flag:
	<br />
	<dd><code>geda.close_page(sheet1, True)</code></dd>
  <p/>
  Objects are added or removed from pages using either the module API or the page object methods. In either case
  the program must have a reference to the object first. Methods in the Creation group create new objects based
  on supplied parameters, as in this example:
  <br />
	<dd><code>pinlabel = geda.new_attrib("pinlabel", "2", x, y1, INVISIBLE, SHOW_VALUE, LOWER_RIGHT)</code></dd>
  <p/>
  Note that the proceeding example uses three constants defined in the constants submodule. The Text object pinlabel can now
  be added to another object. In the following example the label is being added to a GedaPin object:
  <br />
	<dd><code>geda.add_object(pin, pinlabel)</code></dd>
  <p/>
  which could have also been done using the Pin object's add method:
  <br />
   <dd><code>pin.add(pinlabel)</code></dd>
  <p/>
  The geda module includes a collection of high-level functions in a submodule, and these functions automate tasks
  such as creating and adding objects by combining operations. The following example shows how a capacitor symbol
  can be created and inserted into a page in a single step using a high-level function:
  <br />
  <dd><code>AddCapacitor(schematic, 6700, 8600, "20nF")</code></dd>
  <p/>
  Using high-level functions does not significantly impact performance, Libgedathon was designed to be efficient,
  performing operations using "C" code rather than using the Python interpreter. The high-level functions typically
  use the geda module not the Object's  methods. Functions in the geda module generally use Python for type checking
  as the arguments passed to the module originate in Python code. Object methods tend to perform data validation at
  a lower level. High-level functions also except keyword arguments.
  	<br />
   <p/>
  The high-level Adder functions, such as the one in the previous example, AddCapacitor, can use default symbols. The
  default symbol names are read-writable and can be changed on an as needed basis using the corresponding setter
  functions, as show in these examples:
  <br />
  <dd><code>DefaultCapacitorSymbol("capacitor-py")</code></dd>
  <br />
  	<dd><code>DefaultOpAmpSymbol("dual-opamp-py")</code></dd>
   <p/>
	The default settings are not saved between sessions. The preceding examples actually show the "real" default symbol name,
	but could name any valid symbol name. Typically a 	program would set the symbol name and then insert, or at least
	create, all symbols of that type before changing	to a different	symbol. To get the name of the current default symbol use
	the return value from the same function without an	argument:
	<br />
	<dd><code>current_titleblock = DefaultTitleblockSymbol()</code></dd>
	<p/>	
	Default symbols are only applicable to basic component types such as capacitors, resistors, and transistors. Complex
	types must supply a valid symbol name. Complexes can be created and added using either the geda module or functions
	in the high-level sub-module as shown in the following examples:
	<br />
	<dd><code>titleblock = geda.new_complex("title-B", 1000, 1000)<br />
		titleblock.locked = True<br />
		geda.add_object(sheet1, titleblock)</code></dd>
	  or<br />
	<dd><code>tb = AddComponent(sheet1, titleblock, , 1000, 1000)</code></dd>
  <p/>
   In the last example the symbol name was in a variable named titleblock, but could contain any valid symbol name.
   The example illustrates the convenience of using the high-level function. The variable "tb" holds a reference to the
   object, which might not be needed for a titleblock, in which case, the previous example could have been reduced to:
  <br />
	<dd><code>AddComponent(sheet1, titleblock, , 1000, 1000)</code></dd>
  <p/>
   In this case, since there is no reference to the object, the Python version of the object will be destroyed immediately,
   but the gobject version still exist in LibgEDA and is referenced by the page. When the geda module method new_complex
   was used, Libgedathon maintained a reference to the Python object but released the reference when the object was added
   to the Page, in the example above using geda.add_object. Programs can save a reference using the module method
   just as easily by referencing the object returned from geda.add_object, aka tb=geda.add_object.
  <p/>
   Note that in the previous examples for AddComponent, the third parameter, which is for the reference designator, was
   left blank. This is because titleblocks are not normally assigned designators but positional syntax was used as
   oppose to using keywords. To illustrate the difference, the following example using mixed-mode syntax is equivalent
   to the preceding example:
  <br />
	<dd><code>AddComponent(sheet1, titleblock, "x"=1000, "y"=1000)</code></dd>
  <p/>
   The high-level Adder functions also feature auto-referencing and except either strings or integers for the reference
   designator arguments. The following statements would all add a 560 Ohms resistor and assign "R1" as the reference
   designator:
  <br />
  <dd><code>AddResistor(amplifier, 10400, 7600, "560", R1)</code></dd>
  <br />
  <dd><code>AddResistor(amplifier, 10400, 7600, "560", 1)</code></dd>
  <br />
  <dd><code>AddResistor(amplifier, 10400, 7600, "560", "1")</code></dd>
  <p/>
   If the resistor really was the first resistor to be added to the amplifier object then the following two statements
   would also add a resistor and assign "R1" as the reference designator:
  <dd><code>AddResistor(amplifier, 10400, 7600, "560")</code></dd>
  <br />
  <dd><code>AddResistor(amplifier, 10400, 7600, "560", 0)</code></dd>
  <p/>
   In the later case, the 0 means explicitly to use auto-referencing. Auto-referencing can be overridden for any component
   at any time by specifying the reference designator as was the case in the first statement. If the second statement had
   been the 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup>, then "R2" would be assigned as the reference designator because the auto
   referencing systems continues to track designations even when being overridden. Note that the auto-referencing system
   is intended to be fully automatic and there are no configurable options, the system is either used or it is not used.
  <p/>
	Libgedathon and the geda extension module also provide methods for obtaining and manipulating attributes, such in as
	in this slightly more complex example:
	<pre>	<code>pin = geda.new_pin(500, 600, 500, 800, 1, 8, "V+", PIN_ELECT_PWR)
	sequence = sequence + 1
	pin.sequence = sequence
	geda.add_object(opamp, pin)
	butes = geda.get_attribs(pin)
	for attrib in butes:
		if attrib.name() == "pinnumber":
		    attrib.y = attrib.y + 100
		else:
		    if attrib.name() == "pinlabel":
		        attrib.y     = attrib.y + 100
		        attrib.x     = attrib.x + 250
		        attrib.angle = 0</code></pre>
	<p/>
   A complete example is provided with the source code, the script is named "lpbf.py". lpbf uses three other scripts,
   capacitor.py,  dual-opamp.py, and resistor.py to create three custom local symbols, and then creates a complete
   schematic design for a 4th-order low-pass Butterworth filter with the default title-block and the three local
   symbols using Python.

   Detailed information on gEDA Python API properties, methods and functions can be obtained from the doxygen generated
   documents. Basic syntax and descriptions can also be obtained for all functions and methods via the Python help
   interface.
