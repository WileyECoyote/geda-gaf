.SH NAME
.PP
libgEDAColor \- The GPL Electronic Design Automation Color Library
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B libgEDAColor
is an extension library used in the gEDA suite to coordinate the mapping
of color codes used in gEDA data files to actual colors used for output
devices based on user configuration preferences.
.B libgEDAColor
provides functions for parsing gEDA scheme color-map data and API functions
for applications to access color information. This manual page explains the
user aspects of using
.B libgEDAColor
, specifically, modifying color map files. For information on
.B libgEDAColor
API see
\fBlibgedacolor\fR(3)
.LP
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
Predefined color map files are installed with the geda-gaf suite. The files
are really Scheme scripts that are either executed or sourced and accordingly
the files are located in the GEDADATARC directory, see \fBlibgeda\fR(1).
The files names are:
.IP
display-colormap-bw
.IP
display-colormap-custom
.IP
display-colormap-darkbg
.IP
display-colormap-lightbg
.IP
print-colormap-lightbg
.IP
print-colormap-darkbg
.PP
The particular dialect of Scheme used by
.B Libgedacolor
is GNU's Guile. While it is required for Guile to be installed on the host
system for
.B Libgedacolor
to process these files, it is not a requirement that gEDA applications
initialize or even be running Guile.
.B Libgedacolor
does not initiate the loading "rc" files. Instead, application can request
that a initialization file be processed. Alternatively, application rc files
can reference the color map files. Example of rc entries in applications
might look like:
.IP
(primitive-load (build-path geda-rc-path "display-colormap-darkbg"))
.IP
(load (build-path geda-rc-path "display-colormap-darkbg"))
.IP
(load ("$HOME/etc/gEDA/display-colormap-darkbg"))
.LP
.SH FILE FORMAT
.PP
Each color map file contains one or more functions that pass a list containing
color information as arguments. The color maps file normally only reference
three functions:
.IP
display-color-map
.IP
display-outline-color-map
.IP
print-color-map
.PP
The argument list to each of these functions is a list of key value pairs in
the form ("key" "color"). "key" must be a string name of a recognized component
or artifact. Provided color map files contain a complete list of all recognized
keys, but all keys need not be present. The color can be a hex string representation
of or #f to disable color for the corresponding key entry.

.SH DOCUMENTATION
.PP
The gEDA-gaf suite utilizes Doxygen for generating source documentation. By
default this documentation is not generated and must be enabled via the
configuration option --with-doxygen. When enabled, the documentation is then
built in the source tree using "make doxygen" from the top of the source. To
only generate source documentation for
.B libgEDAColor
use "make doxygen" from within the top libgEDAColor directory. Note that the
configure script can also set the configuration to allows generating the source
documentation out of the source tree using the --with-doxygen-out option. For
example using --with-doxygen-out=/tmp/geda-gaf will cause the resulting
documentation to be generated in the "/tmp/geda-gaf" directory. The target
directory will be created if it does not already exist. It is not necessary to use
both doxygen options, using --with-doxygen-out automatically enables --with-doxygen.
The Doxygen configuration is set to produce both HTML and latex. Other formats
are possible, see the Doxygen documentation for details.
