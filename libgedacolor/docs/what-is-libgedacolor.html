  What is Libgedacolor?
  <p/>
  Libgedacolor is an extension library used in the gEDA suite to coordinate
  the mapping of color codes used in gEDA data files to actual colors used
  for output devices based on user configuration preferences. Settings
  are read in the library and stored by gEDA applications.
