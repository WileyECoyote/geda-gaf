 *  This allows a global page renderer function to be defined. If the
 *  function is not defined the renderer, and neither a Page level or
 *  Text Object level render is defined then the bounds of text can
 *  not be determined and world_get_text_bounds will return FALSE.
 *  A renderer must be define for at least one level. The order of
 *  precedence is Object level, then the Page level and lastly the
 *  GedaToplevel. Note that any previous setting is erased and
 *  passing NULL will disable rendering at this level.
