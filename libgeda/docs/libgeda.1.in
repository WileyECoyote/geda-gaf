.SH NAME
.PP
Libgeda \- The GPL Electronic Design Automation core library
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B Libgeda
is a set of library routines used by applications to manipulate data
for electronic schematics and symbols, primarily in the gEDA suite of
applications.
.B Libgeda
provides utility functions for creating, modifying, parsing and traversing
gEDA data, handles all disk i/o operations for gEDA applications, as well
as providing an API for Scheme based programs and routines for evaluation
of Scheme expressions and files for gEDA applications.
.B Libgeda
also provides a limited collection of other common routines like string
manipulators, a configuration system, and math functions useful in gEDA
applications. The purpose of the this manual page is to explains user
oriented aspects of using
.B Libgeda
, specifically, configuring the library and providing details on where to
find documentation on other aspect of
.B Libgeda
such as the Scheme API.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
Library operations are controlled parameter variables and some of the key
parameters are exposed so that installations can be customized. These key
parameters are associated with "keywords" in text based files. The files
are sometimes referred to as initialization or "rc" files and in the case
of
.B Libgeda
these files are really Scheme scripts that are either executed or sourced.
The  particular dialect of Scheme used by
.B Libgeda
is GNU's Guile. While it is required for Guile to be installed on the host
system for
.B Libgeda
to run, it is not a requirement that gEDA applications initialize or even be
running Guile.
.B Libgeda
does not initiate the loading "rc" files. Instead, when application request
that a initialization file be processed
.B Libgeda
first checks for "system-gafrc" in either system configuration directories,
i.e. "/etc/gEDA", "~/etc", or the root of the installation directory and
precesses these files if they exist. Normally, only one such file is used
as a system level "master" configuration file. Following processing of the
"system-gafrc" files
.B Libgeda
searches the current directory for local "gafrc" configurations files. The
search continues upward in the directory structure until either a file with
the name "gafrc" is found or the root of the drive is reached without
discovering such a file. If discovered, the "gafrc" file is processed, which
may over-ride configuration parameters established in preceding initialization
files, and this allows users to customize
.B Libgeda
on a user and or on project bases. Local initialization files are "remembered"
so that when applications load other schematics or symbols in the same or
subordinate directory structure the initialization files are not processed
a second time for a given session. The application requested initialization
files are then processed in a likewise manner, for example system-gschemrc.
Initialization files for
.B Libgeda
should not reference application specific keywords or functions. Since the
initialization files are really Scheme scripts the possibilities for
configuration customization is essentially unlimited. The basic "system-gafrc"
file installed with
.B Libgeda
contains details on each keyword. For the most part, the capability to
perform customization and modifications to parameters are provided for
advanced users, allowing users to deal with complex installations and
maximizes flexibility of the suite. For example, system administrators
may want to change where logs files are written, while ordinary user may
desire to disable automatic backups. Project managers might want to modify
the list of promoted attributes for a particular project. Users should
backup initialization files before making any modifications to the files.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The following environment variables are recognized by
.B Libgeda
:
.LP
.TP 8
.SS GEDADATA
Specifies the search directory for Scheme and bitmap files. The default is
compilation dependent based on the location of the data directory and can
be set using the -datarootdir configuration option. Normally the location
is "prefix/share/gEDA" where "prefix" is the root of the installation build.
The GEDADATA environment setting over-rides the default location.
.LP
.TP 8
.SS GEDADATARC
Specifies the search directory for rc files. The default is compilation
dependent based on the location of the data directory and can be set using
--with-rcdir configuration option. The default is the same as GEDADATA.
Specifying a GEDADATARC environment setting over-rides the default location.
.LP
.TP 8
.SS GEDALOGS
Specifies the directory for log files. The default is compilation dependent
based on the location of the user configuration files and can be controlled
using --with-logdir configuration option. The GEDALOGS environment setting
over-rides the default location.
.LP
.SH DOCUMENTATION
.PP
.TP 8
.SS SOURCE CODE
The gEDA-gaf suite utilizes Doxygen for generating source documentation. By
default this documentation is not generated and must be enabled via the
configuration option --with-doxygen. When enabled, the documentation is then
built in the source tree using "make doxygen" from the top of the source. To
only generate source documentation for
.B Libgeda
use "make doxygen" from within the top libgeda directory. Note that the
configure script can also set the configuration to allows generating the source
documentation out of the source tree using the --with-doxygen-out option. For
example using --with-doxygen-out=/tmp/geda-gaf will cause the resulting
documentation to be generated in the "/tmp/geda-gaf" directory. The target
directory will created if it does not already exist. It is not necessary to use
both doxygen options, using --with-doxygen-out automatically enables --with-doxygen.
The Doxygen configuration is set to produce both HTML and latex. Other formats
are possible, see the Doxygen documentation for details.
