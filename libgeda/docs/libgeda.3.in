.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 8
.B GEDADATA
specifies the search directory for Scheme and bitmap files. The default is
compilation dependent based on the location of the data directory and can
be set using --datarootdir configuration option. Normally the location is
`${prefix}/share/gEDA'. The GEDADATA environment setting over-rides the
default location.

.TP 8
.B GEDADATARC
specifies the search directory for  files.
specifies the search directory for rc files. The default is compilation
dependent based on the location of the data directory and can be set using
--with-rcdir configuration option. The default is `$GEDADATA'. Specifying
a GEDADATARD environment setting over-rides the default location.

.TP 8
.B GEDALOGS
specifies the directory for log files. The default is compilation dependent
based on the location of the user configuration files and can be controlled
using --with-logdir configuration option. The GEDALOGS environment setting
over-rides the default location.
