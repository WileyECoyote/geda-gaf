<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Libgeda &minus;
The GPL Electronic Design Automation core library</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Libgeda</b>
is a set of library routines used by applications to
manipulate data for electronic schematics and symbols,
primarily in the gEDA suite of applications. <b>Libgeda</b>
provides utility functions for creating, modifying, parsing
and traversing gEDA data, handles all disk i/o operations
for gEDA applications, as well as providing an API for
Scheme based programs and routines for evaluation of Scheme
expressions and files for gEDA applications. <b>Libgeda</b>
also provides a limited collection of other common routines
like string manipulators, a configuration system, and math
functions useful in gEDA applications. The purpose of the
this manual page is to explains user oriented aspects of
using <b>Libgeda</b> , specifically, configuring the library
and providing details on where to find documentation on
other aspect of <b>Libgeda</b> such as the Scheme API.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Library
operations are controlled parameter variables and some of
the key parameters are exposed so that installations can be
customized. These key parameters are associated with
&quot;keywords&quot; in text based files. The files are
sometimes referred to as initialization or &quot;rc&quot;
files and in the case of <b>Libgeda</b> these files are
really Scheme scripts that are either executed or sourced.
The particular dialect of Scheme used by <b>Libgeda</b> is
GNU&rsquo;s Guile. While it is required for Guile to be
installed on the host system for <b>Libgeda</b> to run, it
is not a requirement that gEDA applications initialize or
even be running Guile. <b>Libgeda</b> does not initiate the
loading of &quot;rc&quot; files. Instead, when applications
request that an initialization file be processed
<b>Libgeda</b> first checks for &quot;system-gafrc&quot; in
either system configuration directories, i.e.
&quot;/etc/gEDA&quot;, &quot;~/etc&quot;, or the root of the
installation directory and processes the files if they
exist. Normally, only one such file is used as a system
level &quot;master&quot; configuration file. Following
processing of the &quot;system-gafrc&quot; files
<b>Libgeda</b> searches the current directory for local
&quot;gafrc&quot; configurations files. The search continues
upward in the directory structure until either a file with
the name &quot;gafrc&quot; is found or the root of the drive
is reached without discovering such a file. If discovered,
the &quot;gafrc&quot; file is processed, which may over-ride
configuration parameters established in preceding
initialization files, and this allows users to customize
<b>Libgeda</b> on a user and or on a project bases. Local
initialization files are &quot;remembered&quot; so that when
applications load other schematics or symbols in the same or
subordinate directory structure the initialization files are
not processed a second time for a given session. The
application requested initialization files, for example
system-gschemrc, are then processed in a likewise manner.
Initialization files for <b>Libgeda</b> should not reference
application specific keywords or functions. Since the
initialization files are really Scheme scripts the
possibilities for configuration customization is essentially
unlimited. The basic &quot;system-gafrc&quot; file installed
with <b>Libgeda</b> contains details on each keyword. For
the most part, the capability to perform customization and
modifications to parameters are provided for advanced users,
allowing users to deal with complex installations and
maximizes flexibility of the suite. For example, system
administrators may want to change where logs files are
written, while ordinary user may desire to disable automatic
backups. Project managers might want to modify the list of
promoted attributes for a particular project. Users should
backup initialization files before making any modifications
to the files.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
environment variables are recognized by <b>Libgeda</b> :</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>GEDADATA</b> <br>
Specifies the search directory for Scheme and bitmap files.
The default is compilation dependent based on the location
of the data directory and can be set using the -datarootdir
configuration option. Normally the location is
&quot;prefix/share/gEDA&quot; where &quot;prefix&quot; is
the root of the installation build. The GEDADATA environment
setting over-rides the default location. <b><br>
GEDADATARC</b> <br>
Specifies the search directory for rc files. The default is
compilation dependent based on the location of the data
directory and can be set using --with-rcdir configuration
option. The default is the same as GEDADATA. Specifying a
GEDADATARC environment setting over-rides the default
location. <b><br>
GEDALOGS</b> <br>
Specifies the directory for log files. The default is
compilation dependent based on the location of the user
configuration files and can be controlled using
--with-logdir configuration option. The GEDALOGS environment
setting over-rides the default location.</p>

<h2>DOCUMENTATION
<a name="DOCUMENTATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SOURCE
CODE</b> <br>
The gEDA-gaf suite utilizes Doxygen for generating source
documentation. By default this documentation is not
generated and must be enabled via the configuration option
--with-doxygen. When enabled, the documentation is then
built in the source tree using &quot;make doxygen&quot; from
the top of the source. To only generate source documentation
for <b>Libgeda</b> use &quot;make doxygen&quot; from within
the top libgeda directory. Note that the configure script
can also set the configuration to allows generating the
source documentation out of the source tree using the
--with-doxygen-out option. For example using
--with-doxygen-out=/tmp/geda-gaf will cause the resulting
documentation to be generated in the
&quot;/tmp/geda-gaf&quot; directory. The target directory
will created if it does not already exist. It is not
necessary to use both doxygen options, using
--with-doxygen-out automatically enables --with-doxygen. The
Doxygen configuration is set to produce both HTML and latex.
Other formats are possible, see the Doxygen documentation
for details.</p>
