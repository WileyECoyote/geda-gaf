    Opening files mounted on a cifs file system may fail on 32 bit
    platforms if the share was mounted without the "noserverino". This
    is not a bug in libgeda.
    Try remounting using the "noserverino" option.

	Deleting top level schematics before the childern is a bad idea.
	It's hard to reconnect them later. Fix this
