    * etc/system-gafrc: WEH: Modified per commit to Master branch by
      Vladimir Zhbanov, commit  af58712b1c5ab2645b28613e141b5aa57792077e:

      On Windows system, guile post-2.0.11 prepends a %load-path directory
      to the path that is already built using build-path for some reason,
      which leads to strange names, e.g. "d:\usr\share\geda\d:/usr/share/
      gEDA/gschem-colormap-darkbg", in several case, which, in turn, breaks
      loading of rc files by gschem. Using 'primitive-load' instead of
      'load' solves this.

    * src/struct/s_tile.c: Revise function s_tile_add_linear_object, eliminate
      passing extra arguments, was getting incorrect values.

2015-02-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_basic.c: Revise functions; o_mirror_object, o_rotate_object,
      and o_translate_object to call o_notify_emit_pre_change, s_tile_update_object
      and o_notify_emit_change, and set the page changed flag. Technically, should
      also call s_conn_update_object but is really libgschem.

    * src/struct/s_conn.c: Change indentation, add comment, no changes to code.

    * src/object/o_line_basic.c: Change indentation, no changes to code.

2015-02-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/geda/geda_xx.c: Revise finalize function for the following
      objects:

        * src/geda/geda_arc.c
        * src/geda/geda_box.c
        * src/geda/geda_bus.c
        * src/geda/geda_circle.c
        * src/geda/geda_complex.c
        * src/geda/geda_line.c
        * src/geda/geda_net.c
        * src/geda/geda_object.c
        * src/geda/geda_page.c
        * src/geda/geda_path.c
        * src/geda/geda_picture.c
        * src/geda/geda_pin.c
        * src/geda/geda_text.c
        * src/geda/geda_toplevel.c

      In each finalizer, the markers are set to non-equal invalid values so that
      the corresponding instance check will fail even if glib has not destroyed
      the object. This has not be a problem recently, but in the past, G_IS_OBJECT
      returned True after the last unreferencing, presumably a race that was lost.
      This remedy will should provide a solution for GEDA_IS_xxx but probably not
      for G_IS_OBJECT.

    * src/geda/configure.c: Fix missing directory separator in
      function eda_config_get_context_for_file, amazingly, this
      blatant BUG did not fix the issue I was working on, helps
      though, also add file to the config for old style rc files
      otherwise they will not get read when the rc is in a parent
      directory and this once irritating feature is now a must
      have. (The real is the before was that fact that clib only
      use the basename to refer to symbols in the library and two
      symbols have the same name the first one is the only one
      available.

    * src/object/o_list.c: Added conditional GEDA_IS_OBJECT two places

      _select. Now noise can only come from o_selection_add.

    * src/object/o_selection.c: Replace g_return_if_fail in functions
      o_selection_select and o_selection_unselect with something less
      mundane. Revamp both functions to return a value based on prior
      state or an error flag.

      Revise function o_selection_add to not add object unless o_selection
      _select returns 0, which indicates object is a valid unselected

    * include/libgeda/geda_page.h: Changed last_load_or_save_time from
      type GTimeVal to type time_t. Because it does not make sense to
      convert seconds Epoch to Greenwich Mean Time using a depreciated
      function without a reason. Note variable is being set in f_basic
      ::f_save and s_page::s_page_new.

    * src/file/f_basic.c: In function f_save, changed setting of time to
      seconds, last_load_or_save_time; after sucessfully saving and reset-
      ting the changed flag, call new function s_undo_update_modified

    * src/file/f_file.c: Add new function f_file_cmp_mod_time, was going to
      use for Undo page change but that did not work out, but kept, cause
      seems nifty.

      what could be the page changed flag if Undo is used. Added doxygen
      documentation for this module, it don`t look so good. Looks like half
      of the module could/should be scrapped.

2014-09-05 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * src/object/o_notify.c: Resolved two issues, neither o_notify_emit_pre_
      change nor o_notify_emit_change was checking for a NULL change_notify_
      funcs, which would the case if page was created without a notify object.
      Secondly, o_notify_emit_pre_change was not checking freeze count, oops,
      makes a big difference.

      this seem to work out best, say header hell.

    * src/geda/geda_page.?: Revise to support the new GedaNotifyList object
      adding function geda_page_new_with_notify. Eliminated some redundent

2014-07-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/ * / *.c: Redo inclusion of header files

2014-07-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/libgeda/g_struct.h: Modified to allow linking to Libgeda

2014-07-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/guile/g_rc_parse.c: Redo function g_rc_parse_local, contexts
          in eda_config needed real name/path for retention, not ".".

2014-07-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * *: More work on Doxygen documentation; Changed group delimiters to
          use a different style than function documentation, add and end group
          use the double asterisk, as oppose to the asterisk exclamation pair
          so as to allow independent indexing and while searching documentation
          comments.

2014-07-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * */ * / *: Revise, updated or corrected Doxygen documentation for;

2014-07-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/struct/s_clib.c: Revamp function refresh_directory to use
          opendir and readdir instead of g_dir_open and g_dir_read_name
          allow with a local char buffer for reduced memory operations
          and significantly improve performance. Add conditionals in

          Replace g_critical with BUG_IMSG in case defaults.
          General clean-up.

2014-07-19 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/object/o_pin_basic.c: Change conditional to e_type >= 0 and
         m_type >= 0 in o_pin_set_attributes

2014-07-18 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * file/f_utilities.c: Added documentation for function geda_basename.

        * utility/u_log.c: In function u_log_init, change g_mkdir_with_parents
          to f_create_path, eliminate varible with descriptive name "int s"
          and eliminate GDir (using new f_get_dir_list_files instead).

        * src/ * / *.c: Conditionally include <sys/stat.h>

        * src/struc/ *c: Updated copyright information.

2014-07-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * f_utilities.c: Add new functions; f_get_dir_list_files and
          f_file_remove. Rename get_filename_ext to f_get_filename_ext,
          remove_ext_from_basename to f_remove_extension.

2014-07-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/ * / *.c: Replace g_strdup with geda_strdup

2014-07-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/ *: Use new macro GEDA_UREF instead if g_object_unref where
          applicable.

2014-07-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/object/o_net_basic.c: freed return value from  function
        o_attrib_search_object_attribs_by_name in o_net_refresh_conn_cache,
        twice.

2014-07-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/geda/geda_config.c: In function eda_config_get_context_for_file
        add check for gafrc if geda.conf is not found before creating a new
        configuration context.

2014-06-30 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/object/o-complex_basic.c: remove "continue" from for loop in
        function o_complex_get_promotable, return g_list_reverse directly.
        Fixed leak in o_complex_promote_attribs by adding

2014-04-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        scheme/unit-tests/t0105-object-complex.scm: moved; component-library
        to seperate module, t0113-object-library.scm and changed relative path
        to symbols; ../../symbols/passive/resistor.

2014-02-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/geda/geda_config.c: Even more Major changes: revised edaconfig
        eliminating dependency on GIO system (gvfs) because some systems do
        not allow user space, aka virtual, file systems to exist, specifically
        mine.

        * src/file/f_path.c: Major revisions, mostly to take into account the build
        configuration. This was done before but has been enhanced. All path are
        now stored in dynamically allocated memory rather than relying on static locals
        pointing to semi-static environments variables. New function f_path_free()
        was added to free the memory when the library is released.

2013-12-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * libgeda/ *: More Major changes: all pertinent files/functions adjusted,
         edited, revised, and or revamped to use new gobjects. briefly...

        * libgeda/ *: Converted Objects types, Arc, Box, Circles, ...etc to gobjects.
        The new gobjects are derived from the Object type (a lot of work).

        * libgeda/ *: Creates gobjects types for Bus, Net, formally these did not exist,
        the structures were just lines maquarading as buses and line. Note that the
        new objects are derived from line type objects, (was no easy feat).

        * libgeda/ *: New functionality added a needed to expand capabilites of libgeda.

2013-11-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        *: Major changes, to numerous to detail. Most of the changes involve
        converting structures to gobjects and reoganizing files and functions,
        briefly...

        * src/ *: Modified build system so as to organize source files into
        seperate subfolders; file. geda, guile ... etc.

        * libgeda/ *: Converted Toplevel, Object (formally OBJECT) and Page (PAGE)
        to gobjects.

        * include/libgeda/prototype.h: Cleanup

2013-10-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/Makefile.am: Changed AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = $(GEDA_AUTO_MAKE_OPTIONS)

2013-10-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/libgeda/defines.h: Relocated defines for schematic and
        and symbols files from gschme/includes/s_defines.h to this file
        so these would be accessible to the library (and other apps).

        * include/libgeda/geda_list.h: relocated macros Place_List and
        Top_Selection from gschem/include/globals.h to this file because
        this seems like a more appropriate place for these.

        * include/libgeda/s_struct.h: Renamed struct type sPOINT to POINT,
        maybe I`d done went and did a bad thing johnny, real bad.

        * src/ *.c: Replaced all strerror with g_strerror;

        * src/a_basic.c: Added "const" qualifier to third parameter of
        o_read_buffer, which is the input string buffer and added parameter
        documentation for Gerror, which was not part of the orginal function.

        * src/g_rc.c: Separated processing code in g_rc_parse_handler to
        functions; g_gafrc_parse_handler, g_rcname_parse_handler, and
        g_rcfile_parse_handler, (maybe like the "old days",) adding a dummy
        parameter to g_gafrc_parse_handler for uniformity with the other
        two. The function g_rc_parse_handler still exist, and works the same
        way, but is not utilized. (gschem was revised to use the separated
        versions.) This allows reprocessing of groups rather than all of them
        in the event a recoverable error is encountered.

        * src/o_basic.c: Added new functions; o_get_page_file_extension and
        o_get_page_is_symbol.

        * /src/s_clib.c: Eliminate define SYM_FILENAME_FILTER, which was in
        the wrong place. Replaced with SYMBOL_FILE_DOT_SUFFIX, now defined
        in defines.h, added new library function s_clib_source_path_exist.

        * src/src/o_color.c: New file with just one function, so far:
        o_color_get_object_default, more work needed here.

        * src/src/o_complex.c: Replaced s_delete_object_glist with s_place
        _free_place_list in function o_complex_prepare_place, implemented
        s_place_set_place_list.

        * src/s_place.c: New compilation unit, it`s a start anyways.

        * src/s_color.c: Relocated SCM function to new file scheme_color.c
        in order to better organize the project.

        * src/scheme_color.c: created new files and relocated SCM function
        from s_color.c.

        * src/u_basic.c: Added const qualifiers to stricmp, strncmpi, and
        stristr (and maybe a couple of other modules too) and added cast in
        strisubst for stristr.

2013-10-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/f_basic.c: Revised to include new function f_set_backup_loader
        _query_func. This new function use variable arguments and can be passed
        data for the callback, such a pointer to w_current, or not.

        * src/o_selection.c:  Remove error message for o_selected = NULL in
        o_selection_remove, the function now returns quitely, as it would if
        the object had not been found.

        * src/s_toplevel.c: Added load_newer_backup_data, the Master branch is
        has this variable.

2013-09-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/s_page.c: Renamed functions: s_page_append, s_page_remove, and
        s_page_replace, appending "_object" to each of these. Added emmission
        o_emit_pre_change_notify in function object_added, and

        * src/o_line_basic: Eliminated call to o_set_fill_options in function
        o_line_read because o_line_new sets the fill options to defaults when
        the line was created.

        * src/o_basic.c: Eliminated o_emit_pre_change_notify and o_emit_change_notify
        in functions: o_set_line_options and o_set_fill_options due to systemic
        issue as follows: f_open()->f_open_flags()->o_read()->o_read_buffer()->
        o_line_read->o_line_new->o_set_line_options & o_set_fill_options &
        o_line_read->o_set_line_options, (o_line_read->o_set_fill_options was
        eliminated per preceeding entry). And all of this generated 8 signals
        that a change was being made yet the database remained unchanged until
        list of newly read objects is returned to s_page_append_list in f_open.
        o_emit_change_notify is already emitted when s_page_append_list->s_page_
        append_list->object_added is called.

2013-07-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/a_basic.c: Add the ability to read empty lines, just carriage-
        return or line-feed char, but these lines are not saved with the file.
        added line numbers to error messages -save frustration.

2013-05-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/Makefile.am: Change -I$(abs_top_builddir)/include to
        -I$(top_srcdir)/include. Do not know where i got abs_top_build.
        Does not work for distcheck or on Mint (and probably Ubuntu) with
        automake ver? autoconf v? (but did work with newer autobuild tools)

        * src/include/Makefile.am: Added libgeda/edaconfig.h to
        libgedainclude_HEADERS, do not use it (yet)--so missed it!

        * src/f_utilities.c: Change include gettext to include
        "libgeda_priv.h" to pass distro check, currently gettext.h is the
        only "libgeda" header needed but is not found in include path.

        * src/shell/Makefile.am: Change -I$(top_builddir)/include to
        -I$(top_srcdir)/include.

        * scheme/geda/object.scm: Revised path-insert to bypass transform-points
        for curveto, recursion was not working out, just call %path-insert with
        explicit arguments instead.

        * src/a_basic.c: In function o_read_buffer, added conditional to
        check for new_object_list != NULL in case: START_EMBEDDED

2013-03-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/f_basic.c: Added conditional in function f_get_autosave_filename
        to check for NULL filename.

        * src/u_basic.c: Added geda_stristr function

2013-03-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        *: New toplevel glist variable component_groups with associated
        default_component_groups, g_rc_function, g_register, ..etc. The
        new varible is supplied with group names in geda-clib.scm. The
        names are those directories that are controlled in the tree-view
        in gschem`s component-select dialog

        * src/s_clib.c: Added function s_clib_source_name_exist. Major
        revision to function s_clib_add_directory to support categorizing
        and grouping of sources in anticipation of additional library
        expansion.

        * include/libgeda/st_CLibSource: Added variables group and category
        to structure st_CLibSource.

2013-03-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/o_attrib.c: Added o_attrib_first_attrib_by_name

        * src/o_style.c: Add conditionals in function o_style_set_object so
        that styles are only applied if style != STYLE_NONE.

        * src/o_pin_basic.c: Modified o_pin_set_type to include type other
        than NET and BUS in function o_pin_set_type. Added new functions;
        o_pin_get_pintype_attribute, o_pin_get_pintype_string, o_pin_get_
        options, o_pin_set_options.

        * src/s_hierarchy.c: Rename function s_hierarchy_traversepages to
        s_hierarchy_traverse_pages

        * include/libgeda/g_struct.h: Changed pin_type in st_object from int
        to PIN_TYPE.

        * include/prototype: Add declaration for o_attrib_find_attrib_by_name

2013-01-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/u_basic.c: Relocated lots of misc string function from gschem
        and gattrib to libgeda. This may be usefull in other clients and we
        do not have a generic library.

        * src/a_basic.c: modified default case in o_read_buffer to check for
        non-askii char before returning message that includes the input line.

        * src/o_basic.c: Revised o_emit_pre_change_notify and o_emit_change
         _notify to return rather than do calls if toplevel or toplevel
         ->page_current is NULL

2012-12-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/f_print.c: Revised f_print_header to check in s_path_sys_data
        for prolog file, (how did this ever work without path? Maybe path
        used to be in RC file name, do not know and did not review history.)
        Write to encapsulated postscript works again!

        * include/libgeda/struct.h: Separated this file into s_struct.h (s
        for simple) and g_struct.h (glib.h and gdk-pixbuf.h must be included
        prior to inclusion of this header). Reorganized type defines and
        structures into mostly alphabetic order except where inclusion of
        structures in structures prohibited. Also relocated some enumerated
        types to geda_enum.h  Now edacairo.c does not have to have include
        EVERY libgeda header just to get the definition for PATH_SECTION.
        A similar situation    was also occurring with some of the utilities.

        * src/Makefile.am: Added GEDA_INCLUDES variable, as was done for
        gschem to clean up the include paths.

2012-10-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/a_basic.c:Revised o_save function to eliminate use of
        g_file_set_contents because it resets file permissions to
        default permissive policy and can potentially expose files
        that were made private, see bug #1021860 and is was unacceptable.
        The g_file_set_contents was replaced with a simple fputs, which
        is more efficient and available with all C compilers.

        * src/f_utilities.c: Added new file in order to relocate generic
        file related utilities to a common file. See function descriptions
        within the file for more information.

        * src/f_basic.c: Revisions algorythms in f_save function
        in an attempt to stop malware like behaviour. Libgeda was
        incorrectly renaming files to create backups so the file being
        saved was not over-writing the old file. The user saving the "newly"
        created file was assuming ownership of schematics and symbols with
        default permissions regardless of who orginally owned the files.
        Group settings were also being lost. Old algorythms attempted to
        set permissions back but there was no assurance that the user had
        permission to do this when the orginal file was renamed so the new
        file would be left with the wrong ownership, group setting and
        permissions and the backup file would incorrectly belong to the
        orginal owner. The new algorythms create a backup by copying the
        orginal file, using a new f_copy function located in f_utilities.c
        so that the orginal ownership, group and permission data is
        preserved and the backup belongs to the user as it should.

2012-06-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/s_attrib.c: reset attrib_index in function s_attrib_init
          added function s_attrib_count.

        * src/o_style.c: Added new file and implementented functionality
        * src/s_log.c: renamed do_logging to is_logging to avoid name
          conflict with gschem.

2007-05-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20070526 in prep for the next
        release.  Also changed shared library`s version number to 29:0:0.

2007-05-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_text_basic.c: Fixed a memory leak reported by Peter Brett
        (found using valgrind).  Thanks.

2007-04-28  Stuart Brorson <sdb AT cloud9 DOT net>
        * src/o_attrib.c, src/o_complex_basic.c, src/s_tile.c:
        made changes to o_attrib_slot_update and
        o_attrib_search_pinseq to enable searching slotted parts
        by pinseq.  Added o_complex_count_pins as part of project.

2007-04-22  Peter Brett <peter@peter-b.co.uk>
        * src/o_box_basic.c: Fix some unused variable warnings in libgeda.

          In a recent patch libgd was disabled by default (i.e.  HAS_LIBGD
          was unset by default).  This exposed some variable declarations
          which should have been #ifdefed out, but were not.  Although most
          were later cleared up, some were missed.

2007-04-21  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@sentex.ca>

        * src/f_print.c:
          - Added %%Orientation to DSC block in PS output, fixing SF#1680214.

2007-04-21 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves (AT) iespana (DOT) es>

        * src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
          src/o_pin_basic.c:
          - Put unused variables inside #ifdef HAS_LIBGD.
          - Reverted the patch below. Those variables are used when
            compiling with libgd.
          - Removed unused variables.

        * configure.ac: Do not enable libgd by default.
          This makes gdk-pixbuf the default library for png output.

2007-04-21 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        * src/m_basic.c: Fix visibility test in visible(..) for the case when the
          object completely surrounds the screen clipping region.

        * src/o_circle_basic.c: Tidy up dist() function in o_circle_basic.c
          to be much more readable.

2007-04-17 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        Merge changes from noscreen

        2007-16-06 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/o_text_basic.c: Use o_text_recalc() to update bounds, as we do not
                  want to duplicate code. Fixes a bug where the bounds were reset manually
                  even with invisible text (causing uninitialised values to be stored in
                  for the object`s bounds). Fixed o_text_recalc() to silently return
                  (rather than write uninitialised values) if no bound was found for the
                  text object`s prim_objects.

        2007-12-06 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/f_image.c, src/f_print.c, src/g_smob.c, src/o_complex_basic.c,
                  src/o_pin_basic.c: Replace incorrect use of world_get_complex_bounds()
                  with world_get_object_list_bounds(). Changed o_complex_recalc() to
                  (correctly) use world_complex_get_bounds(). Fixed up documentation in
                  g_smob.c to reflect the current bounds code.

        2007-04-06 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/a_basic.c: Fix bounds for embedded objects as they are loaded from
                  file. This places a call to o_complex_recalc() in o_read(), which is
                  not great from an encapsulation point of view, but is the neatest solution
                  with the current method of loading embedded objects.

        2007-03-26 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,
                  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
                  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c: Pass OBJECT instead
                  of derived type into world_get_..._bounds(). Modifed objects to include
                  the drawn line width when calculating bounds. Set OBJECT->line_width to
                  {NET|BUS|PIN}_WIDTH as appropriate in o_{net|bus|pin}_add(). Replaced
                  copied code in world_get_{net|pin|bus}_bounds() with calls to
                  world_get_line_bounds(). Added call to o_recalc_single_object() in
                  o_set_line_options() to keep line width up-to-date with editing.

                * libgeda/include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: Added variables
                  to support (select-slack-pixels #) rc keyword.

        2007-03-24 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * src/o_complex_basic.c: Convert world_get_complex_bounds() to
                  be a wrapper around world_get_list_bounds(). Based upon a patch
                  by Patrick Bernaud which did the same for get_complex_bounds().

                * src/o_pin_basic.c: Re-write the bounds checking in o_pin_update_whichend()
                  to be more robust

                * src/o_complex_basic.c: Modify world_get_single_object_bounds() to
                  use cached bounds where possible. Text objects are special-cased
                  to determine if they are visible.

                * src/o_complex_basic.c: Add call to o_complex_recalc() in o_complex_add()
                  to cache bounds.

        2007-02-25 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,
                  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
                  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c,
                  src/o_text_basic.c: Removed get_..._bounds() functions.

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,
                  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_complex_basic.c,
                  src/o_line_basic.c, src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c,
                  src/o_pin_basic.c, src/o_text_basic.c: Switched over to
                  caching world rather than screen coordinates

                * include/struch.h, src/s_basic.c: Removed screen coordinates from
                  object datastructures, and renamed variables storing cached
                  bounds with prefix w_ to differentiate their world coord usage.
                  Changed s_basic.c to initialise all these variables to zero.

                * src/o_text_basic.c: Added call to o_text_recalc() to
                  o_text_recreate(), since we should automatically keep
                  all cached coordiantes up to date.

                * src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_bus_basic.c,
                  src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_complex_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
                  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c: Tidied
                  world_get_..._bounds() functions to use simple min() max()
                  implementations where appropriate. Fixed world_get_arc_bounds()
                  to have same semantics as the other functions, IE. top and bottom
                  swapped to give bottom > top numerically.

                * src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_bus_basic.c,
                  src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c, src/o_net_basic.c,
                  src/o_pin_basic.c: Modified PNG export routines to calculate
                  coordinates directly from object world coords.

2007-04-06 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/g_smob.c: make g_get_object_type scheme function return
          a character instead of a string.

        * include/o_types.h, include/prototype.h, src/g_register.c,
          src/libgeda.c :

          Register the OBJ_* object type definitions as scheme character
          variables.

2007-04-05 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c: Added two new scheme functions:

            - g_calcule_new_attrib_bounds: calcule the new bounds of an
              attribute with the given parameters, _without_ modifying the
              attribute.

            - g_get_attrib_value_by_attrib_name: given an object and an
              attribute name, this function returns a list with the values
              of the attributes with the given name in that object.

2007-02-24 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

        Merge changes to date from noscreen branch.

        2007-02-12 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                  src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
                  src/o_picture.c: Removed o_object_recalc() and all calls
                  to it now the data it calculates is no longer used.

                * src/m_basic.c: Remove implicit grid snapping in SCREENtoWOLRD()

        2006-12-30 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_basic.c: Changed variable names and
                  comments to function inside_region() to allow its use with world
                  coordinates without apparently swapping top and bottom (which have
                  different sense in screen and world coords. Now uses {x/y}{min/max}.

        2006-12-27 Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,

                  src/o_pin_basic.c: Removed o_..._translate() functions which
                  are unused.

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,
                  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
                  src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c,
                  src/o_text_basic.c: Removed o_..._rotate() functions unused
                  since changing to world coordinates

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c,
                  src/o_bus_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,

                  src/o_text_basic.c: Removed o_..._mirror() functions unused
                  since changing to world coordinates

2007-02-24 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * include/struct.h, src/s_page.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Removed unused
        fields in PAGE and TOPLEVEL as well as functions for old (GtkCList
        based) page manager. (Patch written by Patrick Bernaud)

2007-02-14 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * autogen.sh: Removed debug messages added on 2007-02-10.

2007-02-11 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/s_toplevel.c: added missing toplevel inits (tshowwindow, ...)

2007-02-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/funcs.h: Removed quit_func since it is completely unused.

        * include/prototype.h, src/f_basic.c, src/o_arc_basic.c: Fixed
        a whole bunch of compiler warnings and work on [ 1620806 ]
        various probably bugs and comments about them

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20070216.  Also changed
        shared library`s version number to 28:0:0

2007-02-10 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/f_print.c: Make f_print_header return an error return value
          if something goes wrong, and propagate it to the caller functions.
          Unlink the file created by f_print_file if there is an error in
          f_print_header.

        * autogen.sh: Added automake version number check.

2007-02-10  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@sentex.ca>

        * include/struct.h, src/o_text_basic.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Added
        code to scale the output postscript font under user control.  This
        is controlled via the postscript-font-scale rc keyword.

2007-02-10  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@sentex.ca>

        * src/f_print.c: Applied Wojciech Kazubski`s patch for offset
        printing orgins. Fixes bug #160757

2007-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_arc_basic.c: Applied patch by Peter Clifton to fix
        the output of arcs when using libgd.

        * src/Makefile.am: Applied patch by Peter Clifton to add --silent to
        libtool.

2007-01-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/prototype.h, src/Makefile.am, src/o_embed.c: Moved
        o_embed(...) and o_unembed(...) into o_embed.c so that gschlas
        can also call these useful functions (to support scriptable
        embedding and unembedding of components).

        * src/.cvsignore: Oops, remove obsolete *.c rule that was causing
        cvs to ignore new (but not added) C files.

2006-12-26 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c:
          Added a new scheme function: get-page-filename, returning
          the page filename of the given page.

2006-12-21 Peter Brett   <peter@peter-b.co.uk>

        * include/prototype.h, src/o_selection.c: Update interface of
        o_selection_print_all() to match other o_selection_*() functions. Pass
        the GList by reference.

        * include/prototype.h: Comment o_selection_select() and
        o_selection_unselect() as deprecated (should only be used internally to
        libgeda).

        * include/prototype.h, src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_selection.c:
        Update interface of o_selection_add() to match
        o_selection_remove(). Pass the GList by reference so head can be
        updated.

2006-12-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        Merged Carlos` glist work via Peter Brett`s patch sets to the trunk

        2006-10-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

                * src/s_page.c: Do not free objects in the complex place
                list. It is only a reference to the objects in the page.

        2006-10-21 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

                * include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, src/o_basic.c,

                src/o_selection.c, src/s_basic.c, src/s_page.c, Convert
                the SELECTION list into a GList.  Added new functions
                o_recalc_object_glist, get_object_glist_bounds to
                handle glists.

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_basic.c: Rename o_recalc to
                o_recalc_object_list, and make it to call a new function
                o_recalc_single_object, for each object in the list.

                * include/prototype.h, src/o_complex_basic.c,
                src/o_text_basic.c: Rename get_complex_bounds to
                get_object_list_bounds, and make it to call a new function
                get_single_object_bounds, for each object in the list.

                * src/o_complex_basic.c: Fixed logic level of some checks.
                * src/o_complex_basic.c: Added some sanity checks.

2006-12-16 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

         * include/struct.h: added widget pointers for the modal dialogs
           find text, show text, hide text

2006-12-13 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c:
          Added a new scheme function: get-object-type, returning
          the object type (object->type as a scheme string) of the given
          object.

2006-12-05 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, src/s_clib.c: Converted the clib_directories
          list into a double linked list and reversed the search order
          (last added directories first).

        * include/prototype.h, src/o_complex_basic.c:
          Added new function world_get_single_object_bounds to calculate
          the bounds of a single object, and make world_get_complex_bounds
          call it.

        * include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c:
          Added new scheme function get-attrib-angle. It returns the angle
          of the given attribute.
          Also made a minor fix to the documentation of g_get_attrib_bounds.

2006-12-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/s_toplevel.c: Added missing init of toplevel->line_style
        (all variables in the TOPLEVEL struct ure should be initalized).

2006-12-02  Mike Jarabek  <mike@laptop.istop.com>

        * include/defines.h include/struct.h: Added
          toplevel->line_style. This new entry is a flag to set whether
          or not lines are drawn really thin on the output postscript or
          will only be drawn to the width of pins or nets.

        * src/o_arc_basic.c src/o_box_basic.c src/o_circle_basic.c
          libgeda/src/o_line_basic.c: Changes to the postscript output
          code to ensure that lines ca not be drawn too thin.

2006-12-02 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_bus_basic.c: Added missing call to s_tile_update_object
        for buses.  This missing call could cause buses to not have
        correct connectivity when using grips.        Pointed out by and patch
        by Peter Clifton.

2006-11-21 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: readded toplevel->filename_label
          to the toplevel structure, it`s still required by gattib.
          fixes Bug [#1600448]

2006-11-19 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: moved schematic title
          from the status bar to the window title. Added grid settings
          to the status bar:
          replaced toplevel->filename_label with toplevel->grid_label

2006-11-01 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, src/g_smob.c: Added new "get-attribute-bounds"
          scheme function.

2006-10-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20061020.

        * configure.ac: Bumped shared library version to 27:0:0

2006-10-19  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * configure.ac: Cleaned up to remove remaining traces of noweb
        days.

        * noweb/.cvsignore: Removed file for directory to get pruned on
        checkout.

        * docs/libgedadoc.texi, docs/texinfo.tex: Removed unused files for
        old noweb documentation.

        * scripts/geda_totexi.in:
        * scripts/notangle_guile.in:
        * scripts/prepnoweb: Removed unused scripts for noweb.

2006-10-17  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * src/o_text_basic.c (o_text_create_string): Fixed overbar feature
        to work with UTF-8 characters (Bug#1578416).

2006-10-04 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c:
        Removed the new variable to track wether the main window is maximized
        or not. It`s no more necessary due to the patch from Patrick Bernaud.

2006-09-30 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c:
        Added a new variable to track wether the main window is maximized
        or not. This is part of the bug #1527465 fix.

2006-09-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/a_basic.c: Fixed a memory leak in o_save when saving
        complex objects.  Not a large leak, but this function gets called
        all the time when recording undo info.  Found using valgrind.

        * src/s_page.c: Added check to fix Bug#1562352 (Gattrib crashes
        doing file-save when no files open)

2006-09-28 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, src/g_smob.c:
          Added new page smob.

2006-09-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * configure.ac : Applied patch #1564796 by Cesar Strauss,
        enabling Cygwin`s compilation. Thanks.

2006-09-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * AUTHORS: Updated file pointing people at gschem`s AUTHOR file
        as the complete list of authors.  Merged all listed files in this
        file into gschem`s file.

2006-09-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Tweaked glib detection to not fail ./configure
        when gdlib is not installed.  gdlib is an optional dependancy.

2006-09-24 03:57  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * configure.ac, libgeda.pc.in: Improve gdlib detection.  Now
          instead of just dropping gd support if gdlib is not found, have
          configure error out with a message that tells the user what needs
          to be fixed or what feature will be missing if --disable-gd is
          used.

          Also add a variable to libgeda.pc.in so pkg-config can determine
          if libgeda was compiled with gdlib support.  This makes
          determination of this by gschem more robust.

2006-09-23  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * include/defines.h:
        * include/struct.h: Removed unused constants and structures
        because of new file selection and component selection dialogs in
        gschem.

        * include/struct.h: Changed type of field 'preview' in
        st_filedialog to GtkWidget*.

        * src/s_toplevel.c (s_toplevel_new): Added missing init of
        rotated_inside.

2006-09-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * README, configure.ac, include/globals.h, src/f_image.c,
          src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_bus_basic.c,
          src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_image.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
          src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_pin_basic.c, src/s_color.c,
          src/s_cue.c:
          Use gd 2.0.x library instead of libgdgeda.
          libgdgeda is not used anymore. Work based on a patch by
          Wojciech Kazubski (patch #1479983).

2006-09-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated program version to 20060906.

        * share/Makefile.am: Changed the install directory of prolog.ps
        to the DATA directory and not the RC directory since that is
        where system-gafrc is looking for it.  This bug was found when
        --with-rcdir was used.  This fix is related to Bug#1552338.

        * include/defines.h: Added CUSTOM_VERSION string #define.
        Normally this #define defines an empty string, but for those
        people who need to spin a custom version of gEDA/gaf (of course,
        following the licensing/distribution requirements of the GPL), they
        can set this to a string which is appended to printfs/output/dialog
        boxes where VERSION is used.

2006-09-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/s_toplevel.c: Added code to s_toplevel_delete
        to check for and remove a GSource before it is deleted.  Patch by
        Patrick Bernaud.  Thanks!

        * src/s_page.c: Added s_page_autosave_init to setup the autosave
        callback (instead of doing it in i_vars_set) which was also
        be set in the preview toplevel (having the callback there is
        undesirable).

        * src/s_toplevel.c: Added the init of auto_save_timeout in
        s_toplevel_new().  Pointed out by PeterC and this make valgrind
        happy again.

2006-09-02  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * src/s_toplevel.c (s_toplevel_new): Added missing initialization
        of TOPLEVEL print_command.

2006-08-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated gtk+ tests to look for 2.4.x or greater.

2006-08-30 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * src/o_attrib.c: fix for Bug#1547138: Segfault on adding
          toplevel slot attribute to symbol

2006-08-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h, include/struct.h,
        src/f_print.c, src/i_vars.c, src/s_toplevel.c: Applied first
        part of patch by Peter Brett to add a new print dialog to
        gschem.  Patch#1530417.

2006-08-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/Makefile.am: Removed old VPATH, since it is no longer needed
        and it is interfering with make distcheck

        * share/Makefile.am: Added prolog.ps to EXTRA_DIST to make distcheck
        happy (and it was missing from the dist in general).

2006-08-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * README: Updated the README a little to be ready for the next
        release.

2006-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped version number to 20060821 in prep for the
        next gEDA/gaf release.  Also changed the so version of libgeda to
        26:0:0

2006-08-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/ *.c: Applied Patch#1533798: Remove pre-GTK2 code from geda
        by Peter Brett.

        * src/a_basic.c: Applied Patch#1534089: libgeda: bugfix for
        segfault when loading corrupted file by Tomaz Solc.

        * include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: Added keyboardpan_gain
        variable to TOPLEVEL

2006-07-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/s_toplevel.c: Added initialization of missing variable
        (toplevel->prev).  This caused a rare segmentation fault
        (Bug#1528080)

2006-07-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/defines.h: Applied mouse pan patch by Peter Clifton.
        (Patch #1527361): Allow middle button panning in gschem

        * include/struct.h, src/s_toplevel.c: Added variables to support
        (mousepan-gain #) rc keyword.

2006-07-23  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

        * src/o_text_basic.c: Fixed 180 degree rotated text so that it
        prints upside right unstead of upside down in the postscipt
        back end.

2006-07-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/a_basic.c, src/f_basic.c, src/f_print.c, src/g_basic.c,
        src/g_rc.c, src/g_smob.c, src/i_vars.c, src/o_arc_basic.c,
        src/o_attrib.c, src/o_box_basic.c, src/o_bus_basic.c,
        src/o_circle_basic.c, src/o_complex_basic.c, src/o_line_basic.c,
        src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_picture.c, src/o_pin_basic.c,
        src/o_selection.c, src/o_text_basic.c, src/s_attrib.c, src/s_basic.c,
        src/s_color.c, src/s_conn.c, src/s_hierarchy.c, src/s_menu.c,
        src/s_papersizes.c, src/s_slib.c, src/s_stretch.c, src/s_tile.c,
        src/s_undo.c, src/u_basic.c: Converted all free, ?alloc, and
        strdup calls to use g_free, g_?alloc, and g_strdup.  This is the
        first phase in fixing the slice crash under glib 2.10.x.

        * src/libgeda.c: Clarified putenv/free comment

        * src/o_attrib.c, src/o_complex_basic.c src/o_text_basic.c:
        Removed some residual noweb #lines and comments

        * src/s_conn.c: Finally figured out that setting a freed object`s
        data field was causing lots of trouble for glib`s slice allocator.

        * src/s_basic.c src/o_picture.c: Changed all g_free() calls on
        all pixbufs to be g_object_unref.  This was causing crashes with
        glib 2.10.x.

        * src/o_attrib.c: Added todo to an if statement that causes an
        invalid read

2006-07-13 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * libgeda.pc.in: Re-Fixed incorrect order of macros.  Reverted back
        to the previous order, since the new order is clearly wrong on other
        platforms than FreeBSD.

2006-07-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * Integrated noweb removal patch by Jason Childs.  Changed default
        target in docs/Makefile.am to not build the docs by default; this
        is to speed up the build.

        * src/o_arc_basic.c, src/o_circle_basic.c, src/s_cue.c:
        Merged changes from the .nw files to the c files that Mike made
        related to removing mils from PS output.

        * src/g_rc.c, o_complex_basic.c: Merged changes from the .nw files
        to the .c files that I made just recently.

        * noweb/ *.nw, Makefile.am: Removed all files

2006-07-04 Jason Childs <oblivian@users.sourceforge.net>

         * noweb/a_basic.nw, noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/f_image.nw,
           noweb/f_print.nw, noweb/g_basic.nw, noweb/g_rc.nw,

           noweb/s_slib.nw, noweb/s_stretch.nw, noweb/s_tile.nw,
           noweb/s_toplevel.nw, noweb/s_undo.nw, noweb/u_basic.nw:
         Ported as real c source code file in the src directory.
         Deleted after porting all noweb comments into doxygen format
         in respective c source files.

         * noweb: Removed subdirectory.

         * src/Makefile.am: Updated to build from c source instead of noweb.
         Fixed distclean setup to not remove c source files.

         * docs/Makefile.am: Added support for Doxygen html and LaTex
         documents. Fixed distclean setup to not remove required Doxygen html
         files, and to remove html and latex subdirectories on clean.

         * Makefile.am: Removed noweb as a buildable subdirectory.

         * configure.ac: Removed checks for noweb and texi2html.
         Added check for Doxygen.

2006-07-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * libgeda.pc.in: Fixed incorrect order of macros.  Discovered by
        reading USENET`s FreeBSD commit logs. :-)

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, o_complex_basic.nw: Minor bug fix to properly
        promotion code to properly promote only specified changes.

2006-07-03  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

        * noweb/o_arc_basic.nw, noweb/o_circle_basic.nw, noweb/s_cue.nw:
          Removing of references to `mils` function in PS output.

2006-06-16 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de

        * noweb/f_basic.nw: fixed noweb chunk error

        * noweb/s_page.nw: added function to find a page by it`s id

        * noweb/s_hierarchy.nw: added s_hierarchy_traversepages(), it
          returns a list of pages either in preorder order
          s_hierarchy_print_page(): test function used for traversing
          in s_hierarchy_down_schematic_single(): added page loop detector.

        * include/defines.h: added some flags for s_hierarchy*

2006-06-02  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

        * noweb/f_print.nw: Added code to check flag for vector vs. PS
          text output in text f_print_objects().

2006-05-22  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

        * share/prolog.ps: Added custom stringwidth function to printing
          routines that handles overbar characters.  Added overbar drawing
          support.  The overbar thickness is coded to be 10% of the font
          size.  The height of the overbar is set to the font size.

2006-05-21 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de:

        * src/Makefile.am: moved the comment sign to the first column.
          "make reconfig" is happy now.

2006-05-20 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * src/Makefile.am: Commented out the indentation of the C code,
        so gdb can return correct information when debugging.

        * noweb/s_page.nw: Added one more sanity check.

        * include/struct.h: Moved rotated_inside into the TOPLEVEL structure.

2006-05-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * scripts/notangle_guile.in: Applied patch by Steve Brown to fix
        guile stack overflow

        * noweb/f_print.nw: Fixed missing @ which made notangle_guile a
        little happier.

        * include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h, include/struct.h,
        noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/g_register.nw, noweb/i_vars.nw,
        noweb/o_complex_basic.nw, noweb/s_toplevel.nw: Finally added code
        to support the rc keyword: always-promote-attributes.  This string
        holds a list of attribute names that are always promoted.

        * src/Makefile.am: Changed the .nw.c: rule to redirect the generated
        C file to a temp file and then move it to the real one.  This fixes
        the stale file problem when notangle fails.

        * noweb/s_toplevel.nw: Added missing variable init

2006-05-17  Mike Jarabek  <mjarabek@istop.com>

        * Makefile.am, configure.ac
          Added share directory and rule to support share directory.
        * include/i_vars.h, include/prototype.h, include/struct.h
          Added struct variable to contain name of PostScript prolog file
          and changes to function prototypes.
        * noweb/f_print.nw
          New PostScript output functions.  Unicode support.
        * noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/g_register.nw, i_vars.nw
          New RC command to set the PostScript prolog file.
        * noweb/o_*.nw, noweb/s_cue.nw
          New PostScript output changes. Output code now 50% smaller
        * share/Makefile.am
          New makefile to install prolog.

2006-05-17 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/struct.h: Added variable which controls if the user
          can move objects just dragging them.

2006-04-22 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Allow rotation and mirroring of
          complex objects inside complex objects.

2006-04-14 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * noweb/f_basic.nw: added <time.h> for f_open()
          compiler warning was: implicit declaration function of difftime()

2006-04-13 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * noweb/f_print.nw: added <time.h> for f_print_header()

2006-04-09 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Fixed the overbar misinterpretation of
        multiple escape slashed (bug 1458681). Thanks to Werner Hoch for
        reporting the bug.

2006-03-03 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Finish the overbar if the ending overbar
        delimiter is omitted. Feature suggested by Enoch H. Wexler. Thanks.

2006-02-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw:
        Added support for overbars. Delimiter character for the overbar is
        "\_" string (it should be at the beginning and at the end of the
        overbar). Support for overbars in Postscript code needs to be done.

2006-02-26 Mike Jarabek <mjarabek@istop.com>
        * noweb/f_print.nw:
          Added DSC comments and logic to f_print() so that page managers
          can make more intelligent choices about paper sizes.  The code
          lies about the actual extents, and so does not completely obey
          the DSC rules.

2006-02-25 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, noweb/g_smob.nw:
          Added new smob functions for OBJECT type.

        * include/prototype.h, noweb/s_color.nw:
          Added a new function returning the index of a given color name.

2006-02-25 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/f_basic.nw: Set the backup file readonly, so an 'rm *'
        command will ask the user if he really wants to delete the file.
        When loading an autosave backup file, set the page as changed.
        Thus, when the user closes the page, gschem will ask him wether to
        save it or not.

2006-01-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * autogen.sh, m4/gettext.m4: Removed m4 files since they are
        installation specific

2006-01-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped package version to 20060123 and also
        change the shared library`s version to 25:0:0

        * README: Updated for the new year and release.

2006-01-07 Stuart Brorson <sdb AT cloud9 DOT net>
        * autogen.sh, m4/gettext.m4: Included "-I m4" into
        aclocal to pick up gettext.m4 from local dir.

2006-01-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/s_encoding.nw: Removed extra @`s since they are no longer
        required for either notangle_guile or notangle (noweb proper) and
        they were breaking the build for notangle_guile.  Thank to Stuart
        and Matthias Wenzel for the fix.

2005-12-02 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/s_page.nw: Make the s_page_autosave function more
        failproof, checking all the pointers. This change, together
        with some gschem changes at the same date will fix some gschem
        crashes reported by David Carr. Thanks David!

2005-11-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/s_encoding.nw: Break some lines so notangle_guile
        does not get confused by noweb scape sequences.

2005-11-27 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/funcs.h, include/struct.h, noweb/f_basic.nw,
          noweb/s_page.nw:
        Added definition of the autosave backup filename string.
        Added check for a backup file when loading a schematic,
        and a function to call an app-dependant function to ask
        the user if the backup file should be loaded or not.

2005-11-18 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/struct.h, noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/s_page.nw:
        Changed autosave code so the timer callback does not do the
        autosave backups. Now are made within o_undo_savestate, so
        backups will ONLY be saved when there was a change to the
        schematic and there was a timeout of the autosave timer.

2005-11-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/prototype.h, noweb/s_conn.nw: Added search routine which

        * noweb/s_log.nw: Added an if to get rid of an assert from glib if
        the logfile_fd is not initialized.  Bug reported by John Luciani.

          noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/s_page.nw, noweb/s_toplevel.nw,
          noweb/s_undo.nw:
          Added support for backup copies and autosaving every
          "interval" seconds.

2005-10-15 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/f_image.nw:
        Print error if calling f_image_write without libgdgeda support.

2005-10-05 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>
        * include/struct.h: added the net-drawing patch from David Carr
        it requires two additional coordinates in st_toplevel

2005-10-01 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/s_encoding.h: Fixed compiler warning. Thanks to Dan McMahill
        for pointing out the solution.

2005-09-30 Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * include/struct.h, noweb/o_picture.nw:

          warnings.

2005-09-27 18:31  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/s_slib.nw: remove some compiler warnings (use of char as a
          subscript)

2005-09-19 Werner Hoch <werner.ho@gmx.de>

        * noweb/f_print.nw: fixed color background box size in f_print_header

2005-08-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Bumped the package version to 20050820 which will be
        a real snapshot.

2005-08-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        the path of an rc file, so that it can be found.

        * include/struct.h, noweb/s_toplevel.nw: Added add_attribute_offset
        rc variable to TOPLEVEL.

        * noweb/g_rc.nw (g_rc_map_font_character_to_file): Adapted for the
        new char-to-file hash table.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Improved memory use and global efficiency
        in the unicode support: hash tables now takes a gunichar as key.

2005-02-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Fixed a minor typo that was causing the linking of
        both glib 1.2.x and glib 2.x into the same executable.  This caused
        gschem and friends to segfault upon startup.

2005-02-23  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>

        * configure.ac, noweb/o_picture.nw:

2005-02-21 05:38  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: if we are using gcc, add -Wall

2005-02-21 03:58  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * autogen.sh: avoid using the '-path' primary to find(1) as it`s an
          extension to posix.2 and is not supported on some operating
          systems such as solaris.  Now we can autogen.sh on solaris 9.

2005-02-21 03:04  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/: f_image.nw, g_rc.nw, o_picture.nw, o_text_basic.nw: fix
          some format string/type mismatches, format string/# of arg
          mismatches, / * within comments, unused variables, and undeclared
          variable bugs.

2005-02-20  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/s_clib.nw: Added a missing include of defines.h required for
        s_log_message().

        * include/defines.h (s_log_message): Added macro for message logging.

        * noweb/s_log.nw: Rewritten to use GLib`s message logging.

2005-02-14 22:30  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: fix a "/ * in a comment" warning

2005-02-14 22:29  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * include/prototype.h: change prototypes in public header file to
          not be static

2005-02-14 02:17  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * include/defines.h, noweb/g_basic.nw, noweb/g_smob.nw: put back
          scm_makfrom0str().  It is scm_makfromstr() which was deprecated,
          scm_makfrom0str() is still ok.  Suggested by Patrick Bernaud.

2005-02-13  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/s_page.nw (s_page_init_list): Removed useless initialization
        of page head fields.

        * docs/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, noweb/Makefile.am:

2005-02-13 01:38  Dan McMahill <danmc>

        * include/prototype.h, noweb/s_slib.nw: fix up const usage to be
          consistant.  Gets rid of several gcc warnings.

2005-02-11  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/libgeda.nw, s_hierarchy.nw: Adapted for
        changes in toplevel and page APIs and function set_window.

        * noweb/m_basic.nw (set_window): New prototype: added pointer on page

          deprecated guile functions with approved guile-1.6.6 ones

2005-02-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * include/prototype.h:
        * noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/g_smob.nw, noweb/i_vars.nw:
        * noweb/libgeda.nw, noweb/o_attrib.nw, noweb/s_color.nw:
        * noweb/s_log.nw, noweb/s_menu.nw, noweb/s_page.nw:
        * noweb/s_undo.nw, noweb/u_basic.nw: Deleted functions u_basic_strdup()
        and u_basic_strdup_multiple(): use GLib functions instead.

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw, noweb/o_text_basic.nw:
        * noweb/s_log.nw, noweb/s_page.nw, noweb/s_slib.nw:
        * include/defines.h: Deleted *_SEPARATER_* macros: now rely on GLib

          noweb/o_image.nw, noweb/s_project.nw: - lots of clean up of
          'const' usage.  Seems to have squished all   gcc warnings around
          const.  Mostly this involved adding lots of        missing const`s.  -
          also add a few missing prototypes and header files.  - fix call
          to realpath (it was being given a pointer to a pointer rather
          than a pointer).

2005-02-03 03:54  danmc

        * include/prototype.h: add missing s_project_alloc prototype

2005-02-01  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/ *.nw:
        * include/libgeda.h: Changed the includes of gh.h in include of
        libguile.h required by the scm interface of guile.

        * noweb/g_basic.nw, noweb/g_rc.nw:
        * noweb/g_register.nw, noweb/g_smob.nw: Switched to the new scm
        interface of guile.

2005-01-31  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw: Fixed the escaping in format strings of messages.

2005-01-30  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw: Code cleanup: added guile assertions, fixed some
        memory problems, make it use more of glib.

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw (o_complex_read): Fixed test after library
        search to avoid crash when the component is not found.

2005-01-29  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Adapted for new component
        library code.

        * noweb/s_clib.nw: Rewrote code for component library.

2005-01-28 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

        *  noweb/f_basic.nw, noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/s_page.nw,
        noweb/s_project.nw: incorporated patch by Patrick Bernaud.

2005-01-27 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>

        * include/prototype.h, include/struct.h, noweb/f_basic.nw,
        noweb/g_rc.nw, noweb/s_page.nw, noweb/s_project.nw,
        noweb/u_basic.nw:  Changes made to enable correct opening
        of schematics in foreign directories.  New algorithm:

        1.  Take the filename the user wants to open.
        2.  Turn it into an absolute path, like /foo/bar/baz.sch
        3.  From the path, figure out the directory, /foo/bar
        4.  From this, create the absolute path to the local gafrc,
            /foo/bar/gafrc.
        5.  cd to /foo/bar
        6.  read /foo/bar/gafrc while sitting in the directory /foo/bar.
            This takes care of all the guile search path problems,
            like when people put things like
            (component-library "../common/symlib") or some such into
            their RC files.
        7.  After that, read the file itself.
        8.  Leave the directory set to this directory.

2005-01-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Fixed a bug where sometimes
        missing rotated/mirror components will cause gschem to render the
        "missing component symbol" out in la la land.

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Changed the appearance of the hazard
        triangle to look a little better (angles rounded).  Suggestion by
        Patrick.

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Fixed another bug in the handling of symversion=.
        If the component was the last one in the file and had no attributes,
        then it was not getting checked.

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Further expanded when the placed
        holder component is created in o_complex_add(): when the component
        filename cannot be found.  This hopefully fixes the bug that
        Peter reported: 1) running gschem file.sch, 2) renaming
        a symbol, 3) doing a page revert 4) place holder not being shown.

2005-01-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/defines.h, noweb/a_basic.nw, f_image.nw, f_print.nw,
        o_attrib.nw, o_basic.nw, o_complex_basic.nw, o_list.nw, o_selection.nw,
        s_basic.nw, s_clib.nw, s_conn.nw, s_cue.nw:  Slightly refactored
        and rearranged Stuart`s OBJ_PLACEHOLDER code to make it a first
        class object within libgeda.  Added a graphical representation and
        a few bits of code here and there to make it manipulatable in gschem.

2005-01-22  Carlos Nieves Onega <cnieves@iespana.es>
        * noweb/prototype.h, noweb/s_scratch.nw: Added function
        s_scratch_non_unique_string_fill. This can enable gnetlist
        to return a non-unique list of packages.
        In order to do not duplicate code, s_scratch_string_fill
        function now checks if the string is unique and calls
        s_scratch_non_unique_string_fill.

2005-01-19 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw, include/o_types.h: Created
        OBJ_PLACEHOLDER to signal a complex found with no
        symbol file.  Changed o_complex_read to put this
        placeholder into object_list instead of nuking complex.
        This is to mitigate problem where components were being
        removed if sym files were not found.

2005-01-15 Stuart Brorson <sdb@cloud9.net>
        * noweb/s_log.nw, prototype.h: changed s_log_init
        to take const char as arg since it`s always called
        with a quoted string.

2005-01-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Fixed the symbol version checking code to
        handle the case when no attribute are attached to component.  The
        symbol version was not being checked in this case in the past.

2005-01-07  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/s_project.nw (s_project_setup_rest): Made it handle
        initialization of field current_clib.

        * include/struct.h: Changed field current_clib of st_toplevel to
        char*.

        * noweb/s_clib.nw (s_clib_getfiles): Modified prototype and
        simplified code: now returns a list of filenames to avoid
        limitation on number of files in directory.

2005-01-04  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * noweb/o_basic.nw (o_set_line_options): Moved in this function some
        error checking and correcting that previously was in gschem code.

2005-01-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h, noweb/s_project.nw, noweb/f_print.nw: Implemented
        a threshold which controls when postscript outputted text is rendered
        using the vector font instead of the postscript font.  This is a
        work around for the rather inaccurate multi-line postscript output.

2004-12-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20041228, update shared library
        version to 22

2004-07-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h: Added major_changed_refdes GList to toplevel
        structure.

        * include/prototype.h: Added new function prototype for:
        o_complex_check_symversion

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Added some code to make the call to
        o_complex_check_symversion when a symbol has been read from disk.

        * noweb/s_project.nw: Misc init code

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Added code to implement
        o_complex_check_symversion which is called whenever a symbol is
        loaded from disk.  This function goes through and searches for
        the symversion= attribute both inside the symbol and attached to
        the instanciated symbol and checks to make sure nothing/something
        has changed.

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Rearranged o_complex_is_eligible_attribute
        a little to make it easier to force certain attributes (like the
        new symversion= attribute) to be always promoted (even if they are
        invisible).   Misc whitespace cleanup too.

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Fixed a few spelling mistakes and
        changed version checking so that minor changes are not checked if
        there are major changes.

2004-07-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Added code to specify the rc directory via
        --with-rcdir.  Also set GEDARCDIR for the newly added rc code.

        * include/Makefile.am, papersizes.h, libgeda.h: Added papersizes.h
        from gschem.

        * include/prototypes.h: Added a whole slew of new function
        prototypes for the new g_rc_* functions.

        * src/Makefile.am, noweb/Makefile.am, noweb/g_register.nw,
        g_rc.nw, i_vars.nw, include/i_vars.h: Moved a whole bunch of rc code
        into libgeda from the various programs.  It is now possible to
        write libgeda dependent programs without having to duplicate a lot
        of rc code.

        * noweb/libgeda.nw: Added a bunch of init routines which the
        individual programs were calling into libgeda_init().

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040710 and changed shared library
        version to 21:0:0

2004-05-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_bus_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw, s_cue.nw: Fixed the multi
        colored dot postscript problem reported by Gabriel Paubert.  Removed
        some completely redundant postscript to set the color in the wrong
        spot.

2004-01-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * config.h.in: Remove machine generated file.

2004-01-11 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040111

        * noweb/o_arc_basic.nw o_attrib.nw o_box_basic.nw o_bus_basic.nw
        o_circle_basic.nw o_line_basic.nw o_pin_basic.nw o_text_basic.nw:
        Fixed most -Wall warnings.

        * include/prototype.h: Added missing function (caught by -Wall
        in gschem)

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Had to remove the pin whichend reset
        I added on 2003-12-22, since it broke the auto pin whichend
        code (o_pin_update_whichend; which relies on whichend equaling -1
        when the whichend is unknown).  Fix the whichend for embedded
        components still needs to be dealt/fixed.  This problem needs a
        release note.

2004-01-10 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Fixed the postscript printing of text
        when it is rotated 180 degrees.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Attempted to get the multi line text
        printing a little more accurate.  Not quite there, still have a
        large error when the text consists of many lines.  Work in
        progress.

        * include/defines.h: Changes LINE_SPACING to be a float.

2004-01-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Applied a patch by Carlos for the new
        spanish characters he contributed.

2003-12-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Fixed a really nasty bug which only
        appeared when using glib 1.2.x.  Appearently g_strsplit() does
        not split strings under glib 1.2.x vs glib 2.2.x in the same way.
        Put back some old code which works properly when using glib 1.2.x.
        Bug identified by Stuart.  Thanks!

        * include/prototype.h: Added missing function prototypes.

        * configure.ac: Bumped version to 20031231

2003-12-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw, include/struct.h: Added displayed_width
        and displayed_height variables to the st_text structure.  These
        variables represent the actual width and height of the displayed
        string.  This info is needed when drawing the quick text rectangles.

2003-12-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added multi line text postscript output.
        It works mostly, but there are still some unexplained
        inaccuracies.

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Further refined the fix to the embedded
        pins not having the right whichone set.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Partially applied a UTF patch by Carlos.
        This patch started adding unicode support to the internal font
        table.  Since I cannot test this change right now, I have decided
        to not apply this patch completely.  I did apply all the 1.5 to 2
        changes as well as the memory leak plug.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Included in the above patch was the
        change to make the multi line spacing 2 instead of 1.5.  I made
        this line spacing parameter a #define (in defines.h) to make
        changing it easier.  Eventually this will have to become a rc files
        parameter.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Applied another patch by Carlos to remove
        the restriction that attributes cannot be multi line text objects.

2003-12-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: In search of the "why are not pins which are
        part of embedded components not connecting" bug, discovered
        that if an older schematic is read (with embedded components),
        the whichone variable was not being reset properly (missing <= ).

2003-11-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h, noweb/s_project.nw: Added unnamed_netname
        variable to TOPLEVEL (and initialized to NULL).  This is for
        gnetlist.

2003-11-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * config.guess config.sub depcomp install-sh ltmain.sh missing
        mkinstalldirs: Removed machine generated files from CVS

        * Makefile.am: Added the above files to be cleaned during
        maintainer-clean

        * autogen.sh: Added script to create auto* generated files

2003-10-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added some code to make sure that the
        TAB_CHAR_MODEL character is loaded (via o_text_load_font) before
        its text_size is used.

2003-10-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/defines.h: Applied Carlos` latest tab improvement patch.
        Added TAB_CHAR_MODEL as a #define.  TAB_CHAR_MODEL defines what
        character is used to decide how big the single space in the tab
        character is.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Also part of  Carlos` latest tab
        improvement patch.  Calculated the spacing for a tab using the
        TAB_CHAR_MODEL and adding an offset.

2003-10-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * a_basic.nw, g_smob.nw, m_basic.nw, o_arc_basic.nw, o_attrib.nw,
        o_box_basic.nw, o_bus_basic.nw, o_circle_basic.nw, o_complex_basic.nw,
        o_line_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw, o_pin_basic.nw, o_text_basic.nw,
        s_basic.nw, s_slib.nw: Applied Carlos Nieves Onega`s multi-line text
        patch.        Thank you Carlos!  The next items are the all changes from
        Carlos` patch and my integration changes.  The changes happened
        over a period of a few weeks, but were checked in on the above
        date.

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Removed fixed size buffer from o_save_embedded()
        and o_save().  Also changed the function signature (removed buf)
        of all o_*_save functions.

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Changed call to o_text_read to take file pointer.
        string(s) is now read inside o_text_read().

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Removed old string[...] variable.

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Added missing free() in o_save_embedded().

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Simplified the update sym/sch message

        * noweb/g_smob.nw: Fixed up call to o_attrib_get_name_value (which
        now it`s own memory allocation of the parameters).

        * noweb/g_smob.nw: Added if`s around free`s since
        o_attrib_get_name_value can return null in certain cases.

        * noweb/m_basic.nw: Removed unnecessary calculation from
        set_window()

        * noweb/o_arc_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_arc_save to just
        take an object pointer.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer in
        o_read_attribs.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Changed o_save_attribs to call new signature
        save functions.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Changed o_attrib_get_name_value to return
        allocated character buffers (instead of having to pre-allocate
        them).  This change had significant impact on lots of other code.
        If instability occurs, then look at all instances of
        o_attrib_get_name_value to make sure memory is allocated properly
        and freed.  Name and value must be freed eventually.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: o_attrib_get_name_value() was rewritten to
        use g_strsplit to break up the string into name and value.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: o_attrib_search_name(),
        o_attrib_search_string_partial(), o_attrib_search_attrib_value(),
        o_attrib_search_attrib_name(), o_attrib_search_toplevel(),
        o_attrib_search_name_single(), o_attrib_search_name_single_count():
        All modified to use the newly changed o_attrib_get_name_value().

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a bunch of frees in certain places to
        prevent memory leaks.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Rearranged o_attrib_get_name_value() so that
        a memory leak does not occur (check the input up front as possible
        before splitting the attribute)

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added extra checks to prevent possible core
        dumps.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Removed an extra malloc which was causing a
        memory leak.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Changed the "Found an improper attribute: ..."
        message to be logged to the log file instead of stderr.

        * noweb/o_box_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_box_save to just
        take an object pointer.

        * noweb/o_bus_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_bus_save to just
        take an object pointer.

        * noweb/o_circle_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_circle_save to just
        take an object pointer.

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer
        from: o_complex_add(), o_complex_read(), o_complex_save().
        Changed signature of o_complex_save to just take an object pointer.

        * noweb/o_line_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_line_save to just
        take an object pointer.

        * noweb/o_net_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_net_save to just
        take an object pointer.

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_pin_save to just
        take an object pointer.

        * noweb/s_basic.nw: Add null check in nl_remove().  Added
        remove_last_nl().

        * noweb/s_slib.nw: Removed fixed size character buffer.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added o_text_num_lines()

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: In o_text_load_font removed fixed size
        character buffer.  Added code to set the width of the new line
        character (a nop really) and set the width of characters that
        cannot be identified.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Rewrote o_text_height() and
        o_text_width() to handle multiple line text objects.  o_text_height
        takes the input string (since it can be multiple lines long) as
        a parameter now.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Removed a size adjustment hack when
        calculating the width of a string.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added code to o_text_create_string to
        handle multi-line text objects.  Also added code to handle
        tab characters within text lines.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added code to o_text_create_string to
        not add newline or tabs to the lowlevel text list

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Removed fixed size character buffers in
        o_text_add().  Removed 1024 limit on text lines.  Fixed up a call
        to o_attrib_get_name_value to use the new function signature.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Changed o_text_read() to take the file
        pointer as an argument.  This function now reads in the multiple
        lines of text.  Added code to handle the reading in of multi-line
        text items when the file format is 1.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added log message when using gtk+ 1.2.x and
        a multi-line text item is read in.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: In o_text_set_info_font(), added code to
        set the width of the special newline character correctly.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Added code to set the text width of
        character not found (loaded the ? char instead)

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Changed signature of o_net_save to just
        take an object pointer.  Changed file format to save the number
        of lines in the text item.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: In o_text_recreate(), o_text_print(),
        o_text_mirror_old(), fixed the usage of o_attrib_get_name_value().

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Removed the w_current parameter from
        o_text_height() since it is not used.

        * noweb/g_smob.nw, o_attrib.nw, o_text_basic.nw: Added some checks
        to make sure valid pointers are freed (everywhere
        o_attrib_get_name_value) is called.

        * noweb/ *.nw: misc code format cleanup

        * include/prototype.h: Changed string to file pointer to
        o_text_read()

        * include/defines.h: Added #define for max single line length.
        The text line can spawn multiple 1024 length lines, but a single
        line can only be 1024 characters long.

        * include/globals.h: Added tab_in_chars global variable.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Removed old string[...] variable.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added code to make sure that attributes are
        only a single line.

        * noweb/o_box_basic.nw, noweb/o_circle_basic.nw: Removed all //
        comments (replaced them with C comments)

2003-10-18 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to something more recent, but this
        version is not an official release.

2003-10-05 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Oops, misspelled saved_CFLAGS and therefore libgeda
        was not being built with -O2 -g which probably caused the code to be
        rather un-optimal.  Fixed.

2003-10-04 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Updated version to something more recent, but this
        version is not an official release.

        * noweb/a_basic.nw, o_arc_basic.nw, o_attrib.nw, o_box_basic.nw,
        o_bus_basic.nw, o_circle_basic.nw, o_complex_basic.nw,
        o_line_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw, o_pin_basic.nw, o_text_basic.nw:
        Added the file format flag to the "v" file line.  Also moved all
        version numbers into include/define.h.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Removed fudge factor from width calculation.

        * include/defines.h: Added version numbers, added #define for the
        current file format version (FILEFORMAT_VERSION).

        * include/prototype.h: Updated due to changed loading function
        signatures.

        * configure.ac: Incremented shared library to 20

2003-09-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Fixed MinGW cflags/ldflags

        * auto* files: Updated to autoconf 2.57 and automake 1.7.6

2003-08-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Changed AC_CONFIG_HEADER to AM_CONFIG_HEADER

        * configure.ac: Removed the use of GUILE_PROGS as it is not part
        of guile 1.4.  Put in a manual check for guile-config.

2003-08-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Fixed the test for libgdgeda.  It was failing if
        it was not installed; libgdgeda is optional and should not cause
        a configure to fail.

2003-08-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac: Improved a bunch of the external library tests for
        gtk+, guile.

        * configure.ac: Improved the configuration summary message.

        * configure.ac: Oops forgot to AC_SUBST the LIBTOOL_FLAGS variable,
        shared library was being build with the wrong version

        * configure.ac: Added --with-gtk12 flag so that users can force
        libgeda to use gtk+ 1.2 instead of gtk+ 2.2.x (if it is found)

        * configure.ac: Removed gtk+ and the X libraries from LIBGEDA_LDFLAGS
        variable so that programs that do not need gtk+ or X, do not link those
        libraries.  gschem is the only program which should be linking gtk+
        and X.

2003-07-01 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.ac and friends: Rewrote the configure scripts to be sane,
        much simpler, and up-to-date.

        * configure.in, acconfig.h, and others: Removed a whole bunch of
        obsolete files.

        * noweb/o_arc_basic.nw, o_box_basic.nw o_bus_basic.nw
        o_circle_basic.nw, o_line_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw, o_pin_basic.nw:
        Obsoleted the HAS_LIBGDGEDA2 #define.  libgdgeda 2.0.15 is now
        required.

        * libgeda.pc.in: Added new file which is used with pkg-config.
        libgeda now requires pkg-config to configure and the other tools will
        need pkg-config to link to libgeda.

        * libgeda-config.in: Remove this file in favor to using pkg-config.

        * Toplevel Makefile: Added PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to
        the help message.  This variable is now required.

        * *.in, *.h, etc: Removed a bunch of old unneeded auto* files.

        * Toplevel Makefile: Changed the libgeda-config-install to
        libgeda-pc-install (for the libgeda.pc file)

        * Toplevel Makefile: Removed all traces of gesym-config*, since
        this script is no longer used.

2003-06-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in, Makefile.am`s etc: Applied gtk+-2.x patch by Ye Ma

        * noweb/ *.nw: A few tweaks to get the above to build.

2003-05-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_arc_basic.nw, o_circle_basic.nw: Added missing break;
        to make compiler happy.

        * noweb/o_bus_basic.nw: Removed unused variable.

        * noweb/s_page.nw: Added missing string.h include.

2003-05-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Updated version

2003-02-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

2003-02-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/defines.h, noweb/f_print.nw: Applied Antonio`s no
        margin printing patch (with minor modifications).  Thanks.

        * include/defines.h, noweb/f_print.nw: Renamed "limits" to
        "extents"

2003-02-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/s_clib.nw: Added a little more error checking to
        s_clib_add_entry().

2003-02-18 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Bumped version to 20030223

        * config.h.in, configure.in, include/libgeda.h, noweb/g_basic.nw:
        Applied Steve Tell`s guile 1.6.3 patch.  Thanks.

2003-02-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Applied Gabriel Paubert`s warning reducing patch with
        a few minor mods.

2003-01-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Changed -fnative-struct to -mms-bitfields for
        gcc 3.2 mingw compiler (older mingw compilers are no longer
        supported)

2003-01-07 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/s_page.nw: Fixed debian Bug#175718: geda-gschem: schematic
        silently discarded by adding code into s_page_save_all().

2002-12-29 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Fixed a minor typo by applying Egil`s latest
        extended character patch (missing break; statement).

2002-12-23 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * acconfig.h, config.h.in, configure.in.h: Added tests to look for
        the new libgdgeda 2.0.x

        * noweb/o_arc_basic.nw, o_box_basic.nw, o_bus_basic.nw,
        o_circle_basic.nw, o_line_basic.nw, o_net_basic.nw,
        o_pin_basic.nw: Added calls to the gd thickness function to render
        thick lines in the png output

        * noweb/s_basic.nw: Initialized a few members of st_object which
        should have been set to zero.

2002-12-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Applied Norwegian/Danish/German characters
        patch from Egil Kvaleberg

2002-12-15 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h: Added menubar variable to TOPLEVEL

2002-11-30 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * aclocal.m4: Removed file from cvs.

2002-11-04 Egil Kvaleberg       <egil@kvaleberg.no>

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Changed comment for swedish/finnish characters
        since they cause (my version of nowaeve at least) to dump core.

2002-11-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Added code to print out a message when an old
        file is read in.

        * configure.in: Updated version to 20021103 (an official version)

2002-10-31 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * Makefile.am: Added libgeda-config-install target

2002-10-28 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Bumped version to 20021031

2002-10-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/defines.h: Added a bunch of #defines for various widths
        and the visual cues

        * noweb/f_print.nw: Fixed bug: When generating color postscript,
        the size of the paper was not being dealt with at all (wrt to the
        background fill).

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Changed the hard coded value for pin width
        when outputing postscript to be 1) #defined and 2) properly computed.

        * noweb/o_net_basic.nw: Changed the hard coded value for net width
        when outputing postscript to be 1) #defined and 2) properly computed.

        * noweb/o_bus_basic.nw: Changed the hard coded value for bus width
        when outputing postscript to be 1) #defined and 2) properly computed.

        * noweb/o_arc_basic.nw: Fixed a long standing bug (since July 2002),
        where arc png output would be wrong.  Turns out that the width and
        height of an arc are not always equal.  Bug reported by Karel
        'Clock' Kulhavy.

        * noweb/s_cues.nw: Changed the hard coded value for all cues sizes
        when outputing postscript to be 1) #defined and 2) properly computed.

        * configure and friends: Ran "autoreconf --force --install -v"
        to really upgrade to the newest version of the auto* tools.

        * include/struct.h: Added force_boundingbox rc variable.

        * noweb/s_project.nw: Added init code for above variable.

        * noweb/s_pin_basic.nw: Added code that if force_boundingbox variable
        is true, then use the entire bounding box in the pin auto whichend
        calculation (instead of default: just the pins).

2002-10-26 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h: Added variables for the bus ripper support
        in gschem (to TOPLEVEL structure).

        * include/defines.h: Added #defines for the bus ripper support
        in gschem.

        * noweb/s_basic.nw: Added code to init some of the above added
        variables

        * noweb/o_bus_basic.nw: Added code to properly set the
        bus_ripper_direction variable when rotating nets.

2002-10-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h: Added bus_ripper_direction variable to objects.
        Only valid for buses.

        * include/struct.h: Added st_bus_ripper structure.  Used in the
        auto creation of bus rippers when connecting a net to a bus.

        * noweb/s_cue.nw: Changed code to draw the new smaller circles
        when connecting a net to a bus.

        * noweb/s_conn.nw: Added some restrictions on connections between
        nets / pins and buses.  You cannot connect a pin to a bus period.
        You cannot connect a net to the end of a bus (only to the middle).

        * noweb/s_basic.nw: Init of the bus_ripper_direction variable,
        which holds a value (0 = no connection, -1, or 1) to decide which
        direction the rippers are drawn.

        * noweb/o_line_basic.nw: Added o_line_length (returns the length
        of a line).

        * noweb/o_bus_basic.nw: Added code to the read/save functions to
        read/save the bus_ripper_direction flag to disk.  Also handled old
        versioned files (variable defaults to zero).

        * noweb/s_project.nw: Oops, missed override_bus_color in the init
        of the toplevel variable.  Important since the color of buses was
        being set to zero by gschlas.

2002-10-19 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Oops, broke the single pin case.  Added
        code handle this case (basically do the original world bounding
        box if only one pin is found).  Changed function to take this pin
        count as a paramater.

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Passed the number of found pins to
        o_pin_update_whichend

        * configure.in, *.m4: Upgraded to automake 1.7.1 and autoconf 2.54

2002-10-17 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Added some error checking for the whichend
        parameter on pins.

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Changed the get world bounding box call in
        o_pin_update_whichend to only look at pins instead of all
        graphics.  This fixes a bug which Werner Hoch reported.

2002-09-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Minor performance tweek wrt the 20020825
        pin compatiblity referenced below.

2002-09-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a missing termination character to an
        error condition where an invalid attribute is found.  A premptive
        fix for a possible core dump in gschem`s multi attribute dialog box.

        * configure.in: Bumped version to 20020922, which is NOT a release.

        * include/struct.h: Added whichend and pin_type to the st_object
        structure.  These are pin specific variables.

        * include/defines.h: Added #defines to support pin_type.  Not in use
        yet.

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Added o_pin_update_whichend, which figures out
        which end is the active connection end point.  It does not work on
        angled pins.

        * noweb/a_basic.nw: Added a call to o_pin_update_whichend (in
        o_read) which is called when an old symbol/schematic is read
        in to update the pin`s which end variable.  This code is only
        called if a pin is read in.

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Added code to read and write the new file
        pin fields (pin_type and whichend).  libgeda will still read all the
          old formats just fine.

        * noweb/o_pin_basic.nw: Updated o_pin_add to take pin_type and
        whichend as parameters.

        * noweb/s_basic.nw: Inited pin_type and whichend in st_object.

        * noweb/s_conn.nw: Added code to control which end point of a pin
        can have a connection attached to it.  This is control via the
        whichend variable.  A 0 in whichend is the first end point, while
        a 1 is the second end point.  You can now draw a net through a pin
        and libgeda will only register one connection (at the active end).

2002-09-16 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/s_project.nw: Added new file.  Basically the s_project.c
        that gnetlist used is now in libgeda.  This will make writing
        utils which read in sch/sym files much easier.

        * src/Makefile.am: Bumped shared library version number to 17.

        * include/funcs.h: Added variable_set_func and quit_func to allow
        user programs to use the new s_project_* code.

2002-08-25 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h: Added setpagedevice* rc file variables

        * noweb/f_print.nw: Added the code to implement the
        setpagedevice-* rc keywords.

        * noweb/ *.nw: Cleaned up -Wall warnings

2002-07-14 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a comment to a line which was using
        uref= which is now deprecated (replaced by refdes=)

2002-07-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Fixed the crash when you try to display
        the finnish/swedish characters

2002-07-07 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Changed o_complex_return_pin_object()
        to look for things using the pinnumber= attribute (instead of
        pinseq)

        * include/defines.h: Renamed a few #defines to slowly migrate away
        from the word "label"

2002-07-06 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in/Makefile.am: Upgraded to automake 1.6.2

2002-07-05 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Removed an extra / when reading in
        embedded components

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Removed a log message which is not an error:
        ( Did not find slot= attribute )

        * noweb/o_complex_basic.nw: Changed o_complex_return_pin_object to
        search using the pinseq attribute

2002-06-27 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a o_attrib_print_reverse to help
        in debugging.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a bit more output to o_attrib_print
        to help in debugging.

2002-06-22 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/u_basic.nw: Changed u_basic_breakup_string to take a
        character as a delimiter.

2002-06-21 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h: Moved all the gsymcheck structures to a
        gsymcheck specific file

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Completely removed two obsolete o_attrib_search_*
        functions

2002-06-20 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/s_basic.nw: Added patch by Bryce Denney to remove \r in
        remove_nl(...).  This was done to have clean interoperability between
        the unix and win32 ports.  I do not know if the patch is sufficient
        to cleanup component (etc...) lines.  Will have to test this for the
        next release.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: A few misc cleanups in various functions

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added o_attrib_search_string_single to help
        support gnetlist backend fix work.  Takes an object and a complete
        attribute and returns a pointer to the object.

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Added a null pointer check in
        o_attrib_return_parent(...)

2002-06-18 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * noweb/o_attrib.nw: Drastic changes to the standard attributes.
                - pin#=# has been removed
                - slot#=# has been removed
                - pinseq=# added
                - pinnumber=# added

                - A bunch of functions renamed / removed
                - A few lame hacks removed
        These changes are the first of many that deal with how libgeda handles
        pin / slot attributes

        * noweb/Makefile.am: Incremented libgeda.so version number

2002-06-09 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        comment cleanup

2002-04-08 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in: Changed the function which is search for libpng.
        This was needed for the win32 port.

2002-04-03 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in and friends: More work on getting the upgrade of
        autoconf, automake, and libtool to behave correctly.

        * configure.in: Added PATHSEP variable which holds the proper path
        separater depending on the platform.

        * lib/system-*.in: Work on getting rc files to use above variable.

        * noweb/o_text_basic.nw: Changed the name of the lower case symbols
        to include an _ to make systems like win32 (which have semi-case
        sensitive) file systems happy.

2002-04-01 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/defines.h: Added a #if and a #define for M_PI

        * include/defines.h: Put in #defines for path separater for unix vs
        mingw

        * noweb/o_complex.nw: Used above path separater #defines in a few
        sprintf/u_strdup_multiple

        * noweb/o_text.nw: Used above path separater #defines in a few
        sprintf/u_strdup_multiple

        * noweb/s_log.nw: Used above path separater #defines in a few
        sprintf/u_strdup_multiple

2002-02-24 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * configure.in, config.h.in: Added a few checks for some
        non-portable #includes

        * noweb/ *.nw: Reworked the #include section to use the above
        checks.

          for arcs inside complex objects.  This was possible because
          Patrick fixed the bounding box for arcs!

        * src/o_arc_basic.c: Fixed mirror / rotate code according to what
          Patrick suggested (all object manipulation occurs in world coord

        * configure.in: Updated version

        * src/o_complex_basic.c: Allowed the promotion of the device=

2001-02-16 Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_net_basic.c: Oops, nets which caused midpoints were being
          consolidated away (bad), fixed this by checking first to make
          sure that that particular endpoint did not cause any midpoints
          (if it did, do not consolidate the net)

2001-02-11 Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_net_basic.c, src/o_pin_basic.c: Moved the tile update call
          inside the ADDING_SEL if inside the *_add functions.

        * src/s_tile.c: Added a return if ADDING_SEL is true.

        * src/o_list.c: Made some changes in the various o_list_*

          effects

        * src/o_net_basic.c: Rewrote net consolidate code to work with the
          new connection system

2001-02-10 Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_complex_basic.c: Minor changes, call net functions for
          nets (not the line functions).  All this needs to be cleaned up
          eventually

        * Started syncing with cvs repository

2001-02-08 Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_complex_basic.c: In one of the translate functions,
          removed a whole bunch of cruft.

2001-02-04 Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_complex_basic.c: Added a flag to save the state of
          ADDING_SEL (bad variable name, it really means that you want to
          delay doing any s_conn_update_* calls)

        * src/s_conn.c: Changed the *_return* functions to take in a list
          and then return it

        * src/s_tile.c: Changed update function to return if an invalid
          v, w tile index was ever calculated (this means that the objects
          is outside of the tile grid (which is okay mainly for rotation of
          objects)

        * src/s_page.c: Made sure page_current points to the current page
          being freed in s_page_free_all

        * src/s_tile.c: Changed s_tile_remove_object to take a page
          parameter (so that the objects get removed from the right page)

        * src/s_conn.c: Added s_conn_return_complex_others to support
          o_copy in gschem

2000-01-30  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/o_attrib.c: Added o_attrib_search_component which looks for
          an attribute both inside and outside of the component

2001-01-24  Patrick Bernaud  <b-patrick@wanadoo.fr>

        * src/o_arc_basic.c: Modified the code for bounding box on arc,
          cleaned the translation/rotation functions, added function
          o_arc_recalc_world(), changed the meaning of arc fields

        * src/o_box_basic.c: Added functions to print the filling of a box

        * src/o_circle_basic.c : Added functions to print the filling

        * src/o_image.c: Fixed bug -- allow the background of pngs to
          take on a different value than black, bug pointed out by
          George Billios

2001-01-07  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h: Added conn_list list as well as new version
          of st_conn

        * src/s_conn.c: Added new file which contains the routines to support
          the new connection scheme

        * src/o_net_basic.c: Added s_conn_update_object call to *net_add

          function

        * src/o_complex_basic.c: Had to add some flags to prevent the
          calc of connections for complex objects; the connection update needs
          to happen once all the prim_objs have been translated to their
          final resting spot

        * src/s_basic.c: Added calls and variable inits for new conn system

          are mirror (and/or rotated).  Bug pointed out by Matt Ettus

2001-01-01  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/ *.c: Removed all trace of the conn_table, o_conn, s_nethash
          functions. This is in prep for the total rewrite

        * include/struct.h: Removed conn table and nethash table and also
          removed stretch structure for now.

        * src/s_tile.c: Added new file and function which divide up the
          world space into smaller tiles (will be used by the new conn
          system)

        * include/struct.h: Added world_tiles 2d array to page structure

        * include/struct.h: Added st_tile data structure

        * include/defines.h: Added MAX_TILES_X and MAX_TILES_Y #defines

        * src/s_page.c: Added s_tile_init to s_page_add

        * src/s_tile.c: More work on some of the routines to get objects
           into the right tiles

        * src/o_net_basic.c, o_pin_basic.c, o_bus_basic.c: Added call to
          s_tile_add_object when an object is added to object_head
          (or object_tail)

        * src/o_net_basic.c, o_pin_basic.c, o_bus_basic.c: Called copy
          routines with the right x,y values so that tiling code works right

        * src/o_net_basic.c, o_pin_basic.c, o_bus_basic.c: Added a bunch of
          calls to s_tile_update_object after the object is translate
          (moved around)

        * include/struct.h: Added to the object structure tile_locs which is
          a list of tile locations (in which tiles the object exists in)

        * src/s_basic.c: Added init code to deal with above list

2000-12-17  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/Makefile.am: Bumped libgeda.so version to 11

2000-12-10  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h: Removed zoom_factor variable

        * src/o_arc.c: Finally added code to implement the line type
          postscript output for arcs

        * src/o_circle.c: Also added code to implement the line type
          postscript output for circles (using arc code)

        * src/configure.in: Added back the lines (saved_cflags etc...)
          which caused debug output to be included in the build

2000-12-09  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/m_basic.c: Put some code into WORLDtoSCREEN routines to bound
          coords to +/- 2^15 - 1  This is caused by 1) a less than perfect
          clipping routine and 2) the fact that X stores coords in signed
          shorts.   This may effect portability to machines where this is not
          the case.   The original manifested itself by an endpoint (zoomed
          really really close) suddenly drawing itself incorrectly.  The
          clipping routine I used does not handle horizontal lines at all.

        * src/s_nethash.c: #if DEBUG'ed out a printf

        * src/f_basic.c: Removed all trace of zoom_factor

        * src/s_page.c: Removed all trace of zoom_factor

          function

2000-11-30  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * src/s_nethash.c: Rewrote s_nethash_build to not use the internals
          of the hash table.  New version uses a *_hash_foreach function.
           The original function was poorly written and violated library
          encapsulation (my bad).

        * src/o_circle.c: Removed unneeded variable

        * configure.in: Added -fnative-struct flag for CYGWIN port only

        * src/s_page.c: Put in the calls to destroy the nethash data structure
          when a page is deleted

        * src/s_nethash.c: Added s_nethash_delete_all function

        * include/struct.h: Added conn_list function to st_nethash

        * src/s_nethash.c: Added conn_list variable usage code

        * src/s_stretch.c: Added code to check the uniqueness of midpoint
          connections when they are added to the stretch structure

2000-11-12  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

        * include/struct.h: Added st_stretch structure (and typdef)

        * src/s_stretch.c: Added file which will contain the low level
          data structure for stretching/rubberbanding when a move occurs

        * include/struct.h: Added stretch_head to page structure

        * src/s_page.c: Added the init of stretch_head

          Plugged leak by freeing complex list completely before NULLing

        * src/o_net_basic.c: #if DEBUG'ed out some printf`s which dealt

          the objects in a selection list into a plain object list

          first (all objects in the selection list should be selected) and

          non-attributes right

        * src/o_net_basic.c: Put some comments in the net consolidate functions

        * src/o_attrib.c: Removed the ability to attach non-text items
          as attributes as a sch/sym is being read in (o_read_attribs)

        * src/o_attrib.c: Fixed a nasty bug where the color of text was
          being forced to the attribute color even if you did not want that
          color (pointed out by Magnus)

9/19/99 Make sure libgeda works with guile-1.3.2a

        Added some code to o_text.c to look for char_.sym for lowercase
        characters when running CYGWIN32

        Messed up above slightly, now fixed

        Did not return a success (zero) in s_color_request, now fixed

        Increased the number colors to 25

        Fixed all warnings

        Increased the .so version of libgeda to 4

9/18/99        Fixed a bug in s_color_gdcolor_init, had the gd color alloc in the
        wrong place (before a pointer was set)

9/17/99        Added/changed a few variables the various structures in struct.h

9/16/99        Removed the restriction that sym/sch files have to be perfect.  You
        now can have garbage in a sym/sch file and it wo not exit, but instead
        warn the user and display what it read in.

        Added a bunch of tests into o_attrib_attach to prevent:
                - Attaching a non-text item as an attribute
                - Attaching an attribute to more than one object

        Improved the warning that is displayed when an attribute is already
        attached to an object

        Updated f_open and s_page_new to only open a schematic/symbol if it
        is not opened already.

9/12/99        Added a flag in s_netlist structure for net naming priority

9/7/99        Added s_color.c

        Cleaned up code to reflect the new function names created by s_color.c

        Removed all lame function pointers now that the color stuff is part
        of libgeda

        Added st_color structure to struct.h

        Added o_attrib_search_name_single_count which is like the other
        search_name functions in that it allows you to pick the  noth
        occurance of an attribute but only searching the specified in object

9/6/99        Removed most color #defines from color.h, in prep for the new color
        system

        Temporarily broke color postscript printing
        Temporarily broke color image writing

        Put into colors.h the proper #defines for the new colors scheme

        Put a few user rc variables into the toplevel struct

        Fixed color postscript printing
        To do this, I had to create a ps_color_string global variable function
        pointer, so every gEDA program needs to define this if it has to be
        linked to libgeda

        Fixed a coredump bug which was caused by improper attributes (ie
        pin15=  (and no value))

        Fixed o_attrib_get_name_value so that improper attributes are NOT
        returned as proper attributes

        Started to fix the broken color image writing
                - Re-arranged the allocation of colors in o_image.c

        Got color image writing working again

        Unfortunately had to create another function pointer for
        x_color_gdcolor_init (ugg... I need to clean all this up...)

8/31/99 Renamed ntext to text (finally)

        Hopefully fixed the problem that gnetlist was having with embedded
        components ?

8/30/99        Fixed the bus visual cues postscript output to look better
        (by controlling the capstyle)

        Fixed the direction of horizontal bus visual cues in postscript
        output

        Renamed all ales to conn and ALES to CONN


8/29/99        Added bus_gc

        Added support to the postscript / image printing for the bus cues

        Got bus to look thicker when they are imaged.  Still need to do
        the same to nets

        Fixed a postscript problem when you have thin nets enabled
        (everything would be thick... which is the exact opposite of what
         you would want)

        Removed a "this is totally broken" comment from o_complex_add_embedded
        (I think it works... but just in case...)

        Removed all warnings from the code

8/28/99 Fixed a minor bug: connect two nets to a bus to the same point, you
        would get an invalid cue, which is not right (that`s a valid bus
        midpoint connection).

8/27/99 Set the program version to 19990829 to force Ales to release
        on the 29th :)

        Updated all *.c and *.h files to have the right address for the
        FSF in the copyright/licence header

        Updated library so version

8/18/99        More work getting buses to work correctly, updates to o_ales
        (which will turn into o_conn eventually)

        Added #defines for output-capstyle

        Added code in f_print which does the work of the capstyle keyword

        More work in o_ales to get bus to work right.

        Added code which determines if a connection is valid or invalid
                NOT valid:  pin to bus
                NOT valid:  net to endpoint of bus

8/17/99 Started adding bus object
                Including creation of all basic functions
                Update toplevel structure (struct.h)
                Update of enumerated types of objects

8/12/99        Added o_net_modify to support the stretch command

8/11/99 Added o_attrib_search_toplevel which searches for toplevel attributes
        in all loaded pages.

        Fixed a fatal bug (core dump) in the o_net_consolidate_lowlevel
        function (as well as a possible memory leak) that deal with
        connecting nets together which both had attributes.

        Fixed another memory leak in o_net_consolidate_*

        Fixed configure.in to properly check for cygwin port and X11
        libraries (for all other tools as well)

8/5/99  Added some stuff to configure.in for win32 builds

        Removed some bogus #includes <dirent.h> from a bunch of files
        s_attrib.c, s_papersize.c, s_stroke.c

        Renamed private POINT structure to sPOINT (single POINT) in m_basic.c
        (it was conflicting with some includes in win32)

        Added some more #if conditions to the #include <direct.h>, only
        include this on UNIX platforms

        Added code in configure.in to ignore the requirement for X11 for
        cygwin

8/3/99  Added to TOPLEVEL the net_consolidate flag

        Upgraded to libtool 1.3.3

        First attempt at getting net_consolidate to work with attached
        attributes

        Removed an extra return from o_attrib.c

        net-consolidate code is not 100% working today.

7/27/99 Added o_net_consolidate* functions which take net segments and
        if possible combine the nets into one single net.

        Added o_net_consolidate to f_open so that it runs
        whenever you open a schematic

        Added o_net_consolidate to f_save so that it runs
        whenever you save a schematic

7/25/99 Cleaned up g_read_file(). (by Kazu Hirata)

7/23/99 Added u_basic_strdup_multiple() to u_basic.c. (by Kazu Hirata)

7/21/99 More work on getting all objects to use new object init and link
        routines (rest of o_*_basic.c functions)

        Created u_basic.c for utitlity functions to which Kazu is adding

        Removed all traces of s_passing.c and s_passing.h (Yeah, no more
        p_* kludge)

        #if 0'ed out add_object, replaced by new object init and link
        routines

        Found all unknown p_* variables and removed them

7/16/99 Added s_basic_init_object which just creates an object and inits
        it with default values (this is part of the s_passing kludge removal)

        Added s_basic_link_object which links in the object into the passed in
        ptr linked list.

        Removed "int selected" from struct.h (was totally unused)

        Minor cosmetic changes in struct.h

        As a first test, converted o_ntext_basic.c to use new
        s_basic_init_object and s_basic_link_object

7/15/99 Added support for libgdgeda 1.6 (mainly means searching for libpng)

        Removed all traces of old libgdgeda 1.5 gif support

        Changed the check for zlib (uncompress is the function it searches
        for)

7/10/99 Started to improve the performance of the math functions
        (was doing to much math everytime I was calling pix_x/pix_y)

        Finished speed improvements in mil_x and mil_y

        Updated a few places where it`s important to call set_window
        (part of the math speed improvements)

        Added some variables to struct.h to support gschem rc files

        Added displayed_text_len which holds the true string length of
        text which is displayed

        Added a check in o_ntext_read for unsupported text angles

7/6/99  Did not really disable libgdgeda when using --disable-gdgeda
        Now fixed.

7/5/99        Fixed a minor typo when allocating a string "pin" instead of "slot"

        Hopefully got slotting to work with alphanumeric pins

        Removed all warnings

        Updated configure.in a bit

        Updated version number (in all other programs as well)

        Updated README file (in all other programs as well)

7/4/99        Fixed the headers in all files to be correct (GPL)

7/3/99         Removed some debug printfs from s_nethash.c

        Removed some obsolete data structure elements in the gnetlist part
        of struct.h

        Added code to warn user that a zero length object (line, net, pin
        etc...) was just read in

7/2/99         Fixed the ./configure stuff dealing with libgdgeda so that it works
        when libgdgeda is not installed in a system directory

7/1/99         Changed all gd includes to gdgeda to distinguish my version of gd
        from the official one

        Changed HAS_LIBGD to HAS_LIBGDGEDA

        Added #ifdef HAS_LIBGDGEDA where appropriate

        Missed a few spots in adding above, found them all I hope

6/29/99 Added s_nethash.c which deals with the nethash table in gnetlist

        Added init of the nethash table to s_page.c

6/26/99 Fixed the output of 180 rotated text in the postscript output

6/25/99 Added the ability to generate black and white gifs

        Moved a o_redraw_all from libgeda into gschem where it belongs
        (f_image.c)

        Removed all traces of GTK_DEVEL

6/24/99 Got all the object primatives outputing to the image (including
        the rather painful arcs)

        Added the ability to change the image size

        Added a o_recalc function which recalcs, but does not draw the objects

6/23/99 Added o_image.c (which is code which uses the gd lib to output
        schematics to gifs)

        Added some entries in the TOPLEVEL structure to support the image
        printing

        Added f_print.c which includes all the toplevel code for writing
        an image

        Added support to configure and friends to make libgd an optional
        library

6/17/99 Added o_ales_search_object which goes through entire the ales_table and
        finds the  noth occurance of object

        Above may be removed and moved somewhere else (into gnetlist)

6/13/99 Removed s_delete_head from production

        Attempted to find the hidden attribute memory leak

        Found above memory leak and squashed.

6/10/99 Added the start of support for not creating text items which are
        hidden

6/9/99        Increased the number of symbols which can be in a directory to 1024
        from (256) in s_clib.c (s_clib_getfiles)

6/1/99        Fixed a few minor things in s_page.c and s_basic.c (p_circle stuff)

        Put some checks to prevent the coredump condition described below

        Put some casts to make make happy (less warnings)

5/31/99 Fixed printing for nets visual cues

        Removed all traces of the old connection system

        Discovered a core dump condition in clib_cache_free
        (caused by reading in swedish/non-standard-ascii character font
         files, okay for now)

        Few minor touch up to s_clib.c, but not enough to solve above

5/29/99 Change the license for libgeda back to GPL (from LGPL)

        Put in another check in the o_ales_update_nets function to
        make sure we do not add duplicate objects into the ales_list`s

        Added in code which allows for unattached toplevel attributes
        (o_attrib.c)

5/99        See ChangeLog in gschem for all the changes related to the new
        connection stuff

        All connection stuff is in o_ales.c (will be renamed to o_conn.c
        once things get a big more stable)

5/16/99 Removed ../libgeda/prototype.h from f_print.c

        Removed ../include/x_states.h and ../include/x_events.c

        Moved prototype.h to ../include (change all the source as well)

        Commented out most of ../include/globals.h

5/13/99 Increased the size of buffers and the reading in of attributes
        (o_attrib.c -- o_read_attribs)

        Increased the size of text strings (in o_ntext_basic.c)

        Fixed the appropriate string in s_passing.c (and s_passing.h)

        Fixed text_string allocation size in add_object (s_basic.c)

        The above changes should fix the bug reported by Thomas Dean

4/27/99 Minor comment fix in include/struct.h

4/20/99 Minor fprintf warning/error message touchups in s_clib.c

4/15/99        Added coord dialog variables to WINDOW structure

3/23/99 Added GtkWidget *abwindow to struct.h

3/19/99        Added expand_env_variables which takes a string and expands all
        shell enviroment variables.

        Fixed it so that when you do some attribute related activities
        the changed flag gets set

        Had to remove one of the above because just selecting something
        with attributes would cause the flag to be set...

3/9/99  Remove all // from all include/ *.h files

3/2/99        Added missing #include <stdarg.h> to s_basic.c

3/1/99        Fixed the vsnprintf problem I thought I fixed.  It`s fixed now!

        Updated struct.h (new schcheck structure)

2/25/99 Added gsymcheck structures (include/struct.h)

2/12/99 Added code (#ifndef'ed) for vnsprintf to fix the Solaris 5.5.x
        problem (did not have vnsprintf).  The vnsprintf wrapper is from
        Timidity++-1.2.1, which is under the GPL v2.0

        Minor bug fix to s_log_close (disable the logging of messages after
        you close the log file)

        Found a memory leak in s_clib_cache_free, the index used in the loop
        could wrap, so you might end up freeing only a portion of the entries

2/11/99        Searching through stroke structure fixed to be faster (does not
        search the whole array of structures)

        Implemented a return value of s_stroke_search_execute (TRUE if it
        finds a stroke, FALSE otherwise)

        Increased max number of strokes to 256

2/9/99        Increased buffer which is used for reading in schematics to 1024
        characters

        Increased buffer which is used for saving schematics to 1024
        characters

        Added s_stroke.c (place where strokes to action mapping is stored)

1/24/99 Fixed a fprintf format statement (%% instead of %) in f_print.c

1/23/99 Fixed printing problem created when I switched the rc reading order

        Added code to support portrait printing printing (in struct.h :
        print_orientation, defines.h - a few useful defines)

        Changed f_print_header, w_current is passed in now

        Worked some on getting portait mode right (instead of the _hack_
        which it currently is)

        Changed the way the translating actual happens in the actual
        postscript (instead of changing the points in C, it`s done with a
        translate), much cleaner. (be sure to remove all the dead code...
        maybe?)

        Got portrait printing working more or less.  Still might be buggy
        though.

        Added support for color postscript printing (f_print_set_color)

        Fixed some bugs in the printing of colored nets (end/midpoints not
        being colored right)

1/17/99 More gtk+ 1.1.x compatibility work (in s_log.c) (minor #ifndef)

        Changed s_log_message to use vsnprintf instead of the g_v* functions
        since they were not behaving like I want them to.

1/9/99        Added gtk+ 1.1.x compatibility to libgeda
                g_vprintf -> g_strdup_vprintf (s_log.c)

12/30/98 Removed duplicate code from snap_grid function

12/15/98 Added clip_nochange and clip_change (really just copied and
         changed existing code).  These routines either just tell if a
         line (object) should be clipped and/or the actual points are
         clipped.

         Added SCREENencode_halfspace and WORLDencode_halfspace
         which support above code

         Discovered that my clipping routine was not working completely
         right (slope was always zero) fixed now?

12/13/98 Fixed pin color being saved as -1

         Added some checks in clip to make sure you do not divide by zero
         Assume the object is visible if you were going to divide by zero.

12/9/98 Added WORLDabs and SCREENabs, these function, do not return a points
        coordinates, but rather an absolute measure in either world or screen
        coordinates (such as a width of a line or the radius of a circle)

        Finally fixed o_ntext_print so that you can print out (`s and )`s.
        (should work on all postscript printers correctly)

        Changed the ps of text output so that it uses "show" instead of
        "true charpath fill"

        Cleaned up rest of circlefixme comments left over from yesterday

12/8/98 Added st_circle structure and CIRCLE typedef to include/struct.h

        Started changing o_circle_basic to use new structures above

        Changed s_basic to allocate and free above structures

        Added circle structure to s_passing.c/s_passing.h

        Added some if`s in add_object for p_line_points and p_circle

        Went through and added p_circle=NULL to all the places that needed it

        Went through and fixed up all prototype errors associated with above
        change

        Discovered a major bug in o_complex_rotate_lowlevel, was trying to
        rotate a circle using a box routine (worked previously since circle/box
        used similar datastructs, now that`s changed)

        Found the same sort of bug as above in o_complex_mirror_lowlevel.
        (trying to use box routine to mirror a circle)

12/6/98 Found another really long term bug in dist() (wrong value being
        set to temp var).  I do not know how it worked with this bug.

        Found another long standing bug in circle, again not sure how things
        worked before, dumb luck.  When saving, radius which was saved
        could have been zero due to how the circle is represented in memory
        (stupidly)

12/5/98 Found a nasty bug in the printing of X endpoint lines, was using
        offset variable instead of cross, also had the wrong variables
        in various places

12/3/98        Added Tom Javen`s finnish / swedish libgeda patch to o_ntext_basic.c

11/27/98 Apparently I did not fix the %! in f_print.c so now it`s definately
         fixed

11/18/98 Removed some irrelavent/dead/wasteful code from m_basic.c (math
         routines)

11/15/98 Added code to center LIMITS printed schematics

         Added code to deal with space.sym (the right way) (when reading in
         the width specifier)

         Added backtick.sym to o_ntext_basic.c

11/6/98 Added sort routine to s_clib_getfiles (so that components are in
        alphabetical order when displayed)

        Added support to TOPLEVEL struct for print dialog box

        Added s_papersizes.c, place to hold paper sizes read from rc file

        Added print_output_type to TOPLEVEL structure

11/5/98        Added paper_width, paper_height to the TOPLEVEL structure

        Started work on generalizing the postscript printing (print to
        any papersize)

        Started work on being able to print out the current window

10/28/98 Cleaned up o_ntext_basic to get rid of special code for space
         character

10/25/98 Cleaned up all warnings (-Wall only)

         Added some error checking in a few misc places

         Added version information to o_save (o_save_write_header)

         Added version information reading to o_read

         Passed version info to all o_*_read functions (this was done so,
         because o_read is called recursively)

10/24/98 Added the ability to have comments in schematic files, but they are
         not saved...

10/22/98 Removed arc bounding code again... still not working right

         Added o_attrib_slot_update (update pins based on slot, given complex)

         Added o_attrib_search_slot_number (search for slot#)

         Added o_attrib_search_pin_number (search for pin#)

         Added o_attrib_slot_copy (copy pin information over to new complex)

         Added the o_attrib_slot_copy to o_complex_copy

         Found a memory leak in the above code, fixed (along with some other
         major/minor bugs)

         Got the first working version of the slotting done

10/18/98 Added o_attrib_search_slot

         Changed o_attrib_search_name_single to return the object where the
         attribute lives

         Added a bunch of o_attrib_search_name_* function to search for
         various standard attributes

10/17/98 Applied patch by Roger to add variable grid spacing

10/15/98 Attempt to fix the arc bounding code (does not quite work 100%)

10/12/98 Found a small bug in world_get_circle_bounds which was causing
         a_zoom_limits to set the wrong value if a circle was the largest
         object

         Finally fixed o_arc_add so that it takes world coords like all
         the other objects! Woo Hoo!

10/10/98 Added netlist structures to struct.h

         Added visited flag to object structure

10/9/98 Removed some really old #if 0 and did a small amount of code cleanup

10/8/98 Worked some more on the mirror code of complex objects

        Almost working except for text inside components which is unmirrored
        (that displays incorrectly)

10/6/98 Broke schematic format again with the addition of the mirror flag
        on complex objects

        Added code to implement above

        Changed the way the rotating of complex is done

10/5/98 Added o_line_mirror

        Found a nasty cpu sucker, in o_ntext_rotate, where you were doing
        the rotate effectively twice.  Oops.  Removed one line rotate while
        loop

        Added rest of o_*_mirror

        Worked on o_ntext_mirror

        Worked on o_complex_mirror

        Added all o_*_mirror_world

        Found/fixed a minor bug in the text rotate dealing with the mirror of
        attributes (mirroring wrong point when mirroring attributes)

        Discovered a case which broke arc printing (negative sweep angles),
        Hacked something together to fix it, but unknown if it`s a complete
        solution

        Figured out how to finish up complex mirrors, but that will have
        to wait till tomorrow.

10/4/98 Worked on gettting printing working and flexible (f_print)

        Got text to be printed using native postscript fonts.  The mapping
        between the stroked fonts and the real ones is really close, not
        perfect, but close.

10/1/98 Fixed all warnings (with -Wall)

        Found a place where temp_parent was not being used to temporarly
        hold object_parent (o_list.c _copy_all)

        Added README and COPYING

9/30/98        Added code to have text that is rotate 180 degrees be upright and
        readable (almost perfect, but still need to get it exactly looking
        right) (text with bars and text with subscripts does not rotate right,
        but that can be fixed in a better way)

9/29/98 Today starts the new release system: 19980929

        Added o_attrib_copy_all (to copy attribute lists), useful when you
        rotate components (and the attribute list is discarded)

        Added o_attrib_reattach and o_attrib_set_color to help support the
        proper continuation of attached attributes to complexes when they
        are rotated

0.0.5
-------
9/27/98 Fixed o_complex_*_rotate functions to actually work
        Modelled after the ntext ones

        Found a rotate bug in arc_world if you passed in a zero angle
        Made a similar change to all the rotate_world functions

        Found a new bug in arc_rotate_world, arc`s were not being rotated
        correctly

        Moved the highly gschem specific o_complex_rotate into gschem/

        Fixed the broken x_update_log call in s_log_message

9/26/98 Added o_*_rotate_world routines

        More attempts at getting complex`s to read and rotate in correctly

        Added o_ntext_rotate_lowlevel (which properly rotates text
        based on angle)

        Fixed rotate_point_90 so that it can accept any angle in increments
        of 90 degrees.

        Wrote and Got o_ntext_rotate working (which rotates text when you
        hit the rotate button)

9/25/98 Added the angle argument to the complex type (this breaks all
        schematic files!!) (embedded components now totally broken)

9/23/98        Fixed snap_grid, so that it would work on negative inputs (doh!)

        Added rotate_point_90, a simplied more general func of rotate_point
        Might be removed in the future, but for now is guaranteed to work.

        Fixed o_line_rotate (better name) and to use above function

        Added all the o_*_rotate functions, most stubbed, only ones that work
        are the line related ones

9/17/98 New code for snapping to the grid (m_basic.c)

9/13/98        Added scheme_directory to the TOPLEVEL structure

9/12/98 Added return_zoom_number (m_basic.c)

        Added world_get_complex_bounds (o_complex_basic.c)

        Added o_complex_world_translate_toplevel (for object like components)
        which should be completely translated (o_complex_basic.c)

        Added world_get_ntext_bounds (o_ntext_basic.c)

        Fixed a bug in o_ntext_add where the bounding box of the text item
        was not being set (incorrect call to get_ntext_bounds)

        Fixed a bug in the translate_all deal with complex objects, wrong
        complex translate was being called (should have been _toplevel)

9/4/98        Switched to -version-info since it`s more portable

        Moved o_basic (mostly) out of libgeda and into gschem

        Removed a lot of gschem specific functions out of libgeda

        Made some function pointers so that various functions can be
        revectored (very useful)

9/3/98        Create libgeda using libtool

        Forced library name to use -release instead of -version-info
        because library will change drastically for a while

        Started work on breaking (removing specifics) libgeda from gschem
