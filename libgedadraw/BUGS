Dist Check
------------
make distcheck can configure with the current config.h, but the
subsquent VPATH build will not link to the free-type library, so
if the in-source config.h defines HAVE_XFT libgedadraw will be
built expecting linkage to functions in the free-type library but
gschem linkage will fail during the distcheck. If this happens,
reconfigure the source tree without "--enable-Xft" and then the
make distcheck will pass. This is not a BUG, at least not a BUG
in libgedadraw.
