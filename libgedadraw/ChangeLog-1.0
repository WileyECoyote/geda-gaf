     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Include config.h, this changes the offsets in
       the class structure when HAVE_XFT is or is not defined.

     * include/geda_x11.hpp: Add comments to document the issue including
       config.h.

     * include/geda_x11.hpp: Tweak inline GetLineWidth to use linear scaling;
       m=1/(scale + 0.14) and b=1.15 seems to closely approximate the scaling
       used by Cairo but Cairo's anti-aliasing blurs edge definitions a bit
       and this make it difficult to compare pixels wise, is close enough.
       Edges of lines using X11 look sharp, but neither do a good job with
       angles.

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Fix resetting of gc GCLineStyle bits for solid
       line types when rendering nets and buses. If discontinuous lines were
       drawn prior to rendering nets and buses, the same style was applied to
       the nets and buses, regular lines were not affected. Revise logic for
       geda_utility_string_stristr results.

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: : Reduce scope and unnecessary initialization
       of variables in modules. Check for pointer o_pic before referencing
       in function geda_x11_draw_picture.

2016-01-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     * geda_x11.cpp: Checkline objecttype.

2015-10-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     * include/*: Update file headers; add GNU URL.

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Update file headers; add GNU URL. Add Doxygen todo
       "template" block.

2015-08-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Remove initialization warning directives for method
       geda_x11_draw_path. Initialize variables to appease compiler.

2015-08-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Revise EdaX11Render::GetRotation to appease compiler,
       eliminating GCC_DIAGNOSTIC_AWARE.

2015-08-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Initialize tmp_string==NULL in geda_x11_draw_set_font_name

2015-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Use GCC_DIAGNOSTIC_AWARE macro, GCC vsion > 40603

2015-07-30 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     * src/Makefile.am: Revert "Add GUILE_CFLAGS to AM_CFLAGS"

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Add #define WITHOUT_GUILE 1 before including libgeda.h.

2015-07-30 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     * src/Makefile.am: Add GUILE_CFLAGS to AM_CFLAGS, library does not use Guile
       but libgeda is included and libgeda.h includes libguile.h.

     *: Continuing development of new renderer: Fix font hash cache for core fonts.
        Performance with core fonts is 4 times faster than Xft fonts and more than
        a magnitude of order better than cairo, testing using geda_fonts.sch, though
        testing has been limited to static zoom levels. Also tested with inverter.sch
        with first test comming in 50 percent faster then any previous tests using
        this file. Quality needs improvement, there is no anti-aliasing.

2015-01-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     *: Continuing development of new renderer: added functions CreateFontHash,
        HashSetFont (major performance improvement), CreateXftFont (no significant
        increase in performance but opens door for freetype with angles), geda_
        x11_draw_get_font_slant and geda_x11_draw_get_font_weight.

2014-12-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     *: Continuing development of new renderer, picture images now functional
        for all supported image formats, though maybe Molasses Renderer, needs
        more work. All primary objects are now working, secondary objects like
        markers are absent and no anti-aliasing, so somewhat ugly.

2014-12-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     *: Continuing development of new renderer, add font routines as needed to
        set and restore the basic font configuration.

2014-12-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     *: Switch code base to c++ to improve performance (by having an object rather
        than procedural - and yet another G-object is out of the question. Cpp also
        allows for better handling of X11 errors.)

2014-11-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     *: New library libgedadraw created to provide a higher quality replacement for
        libgedacario, the quality of cario based graphic is deplorable and the quality
        of the pango routines are even worst.
