     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Initialize tmp_string==NULL in geda_x11_draw_set_font_name

2015-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Use GCC_DIAGNOSTIC_AWARE macro, GCC vsion > 40603

     * src/Makefile.am: Revert "Add GUILE_CFLAGS to AM_CFLAGS"

     * src/x11/geda_x11.cpp: Add #define WITHOUT_GUILE 1 before including libgeda.h.

     * src/Makefile.am: Add GUILE_CFLAGS to AM_CFLAGS, library does not use Guile
       but libgeda is included and libgeda.h includes libguile.h.

     *: Continuing development of new renderer: Fix font hash cache for core fonts.
        Performance with core fonts is 4 times faster than Xft fonts and more than
        a magnitude of order better than cairo, testing using geda_fonts.sch, though
        testing has been limited to static zoom levels. Also tested with inverter.sch
        with first test comming in 50 percent faster then any previous tests using
        this file. Quality needs improvement, there is no anti-aliasing.

     *: Continuing development of new renderer: added functions CreateFontHash,
        HashSetFont (major performance improvement), CreateXftFont (no significant
        increase in performance but opens door for freetype with angles), geda_
        x11_draw_get_font_slant and geda_x11_draw_get_font_weight.

     *: Continuing development of new renderer, picture images now functional
        for all supported image formats, though maybe Molasses Renderer, needs
        more work. All primary objects are now working, secondary objects like
        markers are absent and no anti-aliasing, so somewhat ugly.

     *: Continuing development of new renderer, add font routines as needed to
        set and restore the basic font configuration.

     *: Switch code base to c++ to improve performance (by having an object rather
        than procedural - and yet another G-object is out of the question. Cpp also
        allows for better handling of X11 errors.)

     *: New library libgedadraw created to provide a higher quality replacement for
        libgedacario, the quality of cario based graphic is deplorable and the quality
        of the pango routines are even worst.
