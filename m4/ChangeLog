2018-07-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-python.m4: Add module specific linker flags as PYMODULE_LDFLAGS
      to change the library module extension to ".pyd" on Win32 host to
      simplify loading; .dll require ctype, for loading, hassle.

2018-07-09 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-windows.m4: Add STACK_PROTECTOR to include libssp (for gschem)
      when linking on MinGW platforms otherwise we encounter an undefined
      reference to __stack_chk_guard.

2018-07-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-python.m4: Remove setting py_exec_prefix in AX_PYTHON_MOD_PATH
      because the result is not used. Revise AX_CHECK_PYTHON_HEADERS to
      conditionally set py_prefix and py_exec_prefix so the backslashes
      can be replaced with forward slashes, otherwise parentheses are
      required in the Makefile.am to keep sh from eating the seperators
      and conditionally set PYTHON_LDFLAGS in AX_CHECK_PYTHON to append
      -ldl on the no Win32 flags.

2018-07-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-python.m4: Require AX_HOST and conditionaly set PYTHON_MODDIR and

2018-07-04 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-gtk.m4: Replace GDK_CFLAGS and GDK_LIBS with GDK_PIXBUF_CFLAGS and
      GDK_PIXBUF_LIBS in a vane effort to locate the gdk_pixbuf_loader_write
      in gtk/lib/libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.dll.a, which is present but not found in
      gtk+-bundle_2.24.10-20120208_win32. Another bocked Gtk job.

2018-06-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-host.m4: Add AM_CONDITIONAL for each potential build platform.

    * geda-windows.m4: Add -mconsole option to MINGW_GUI_LDFLAGS so that gattrib
      and gschem can output to the console. Oddly the console programs output to
      the console without either option.

2018-06-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-std-checks.m4: Add check for existence of gnu/libc-version.h, which

      a convenient method to investigate building with c99 coding standards.

2017-11-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-directories.m4: Replace AC_SUBST with AC_DEFINE_DIR for GEDARCDIR. Add define
      GEDA_USE_HOME_ETC if configuration files are to be where God intended them.

2017-09-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * /m4/geda-libgedacairo.m4: Add section for LIBGEDACAIRO_DOT_VERSION,
      bump series to 1.1 and update copyright.

2017-04-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

2017-01-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-libgedauio.m4: Add section for LIBGEDAUIO_GETTEXT_DOMAIN.

    * geda-intl.m4: Add new file to check if with_local_libintl was passed
      to configure; set USE_LOCAL_LIBINTL and substitute LOCAL_LIBINTL if
      the local static library is to be built. The library would be built
      if this option is enabled anyways.

2017-01-10 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-directories.m4: Expand $localedir to EXPANDED_LOCALEDIR.

2016-12-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-python.m4: Rename local function AM_CHECK_PYMOD->AX_CHECK_PYMOD,
      is confusing to me and eliminate checking the version of the mutagen
      module. Turns out mutagen module = Mutagen, which is a Python module
      to handle audio metadata, who knew?

2016-11-17 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * ax_func_mkdir.m4: Add file with function AX_FUNC_MKDIR to set in
      determining if MKDIR_TAKES_ONE_ARG, for MinGW builds.

    * geda-gtk.m4: Revise AX_CHECK_GTK to check if something was passed to
      the function, and pass local variable to PKG_CHECK_MODULES unquoted.
      This seems to resolve an issues with MinGW's autoconf and pkg-config
      being able to sort out the correct version, otherwise an error was
      generated stated the install version 2.24.28 was lass than 2.16.0.

2016-11-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-groff.m4: Initialize HAVE_GROFF_HTML to no and check AM_CONDITIONAL
      HAVE_GROFF_HTML = yes, because on systems without a groff HAVE_GROFF_HTML
      was not defined and then "X" != "Xno" in true. This was annoying because
      suite would configure and then fail during the build, of course that does
      not happen now, but the html man pages will get not generated.

    * geda-python.m4: Change the results variable of checking for headers to use
      have_python, like other m4 functions that use the with/have convention and
      change the AM_CONDITIONAL HAVE_PYTHON to test for yes, not no.

2016-11-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-ld-flags.m4: Rename AX_CHECK_LD_FLAGS->AX_SETUP_LD_FLAGS.

2016-11-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-gtk.m4: Add GDK_CFLAGS and GDK_LIBS separately from Gtk.

    * geda-x11.m4: Require AX_HOST in AX_CHECK_X11, check for XRenderFindFormat
      and add lXrender, rename XFT -> have_xft.

2016-10-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-python.m4: Remove AM_CONDITIONAL(HAVE_PYGOBJECT) and AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED
      whether or not PYGOBJECT is present. This because the former results in errors
      be generated if python is not present since the default is to enable, punting
      on this one.

    * geda-x11.m4: Revise AX_CHECK_X11 to conditionally set the default --with-x
      based on OS_LINUX, if yes then default to yes, otherwise no.

2016-10-18 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-guile.m4: Disable support for srfi-64 unless specifically enabled
      by the user as the srfi-64.scm module seems to be absent from guile
      installations until version 2.0.11, which means srfi-64.scm is probably
      not included with any current stable distributions, more importantly;
      srfi-64 is not currently on Travis-CI machines (Ubuntu/Linaro 12.11,04),
      and still would not be available even if Travis-CI completes the upgrade
      to Ubuntu/Trusty 14.10.

2016-08-11 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * m4/geda-guile.m4: Add define HAVE_GUILE_VER2, conditional HAVE_SRFI_64,
      and check for scm_c_public_variable.

2016-06-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-gtk.m4: Add check for gtk_window_group_get_current_grab function.

2016-02-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-x11.m4: Mostly revamp, must have been worn down by AutoMake
      or AutoConf.

2016-02-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * mgeda-libgedacolor.m4: Add file, forgot to commit 02-12.

2016-01-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-gtk.m4: Add check for gdkkeysyms-compat.h header and functions
      gtk_show_uri and gdk_window_get_width.

2015-12-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-automake-options.m4: Remove version and subdir-objects from
      AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE; no can do dirstamps, and with objects in the
      source directories likely to delete something important one day.

2015-12-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-automake-options.m4: Revamp to eliminate AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS,
      relocate AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE from configure.ac to AX_INIT_AUTOMAKE
      and set options using M4 macro.

2015-11-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-std-checks.m4: Add check for hypot function.

    * geda-debug.m4: Correct file name in file header.

      flags

    * autogen.sh: Stop patch from making noise

2014-12-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-x11.m4: Revised FreeType with enable option, defaulting
      to off, at least for now. After optimization, the free-type font
      extension server is still too slow, roughly halve the performence
      of Cairo and the default XFont server. Still work in progress.

2014-11-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * geda-std-checks.m4: Add check header float.h in AX_GEDA_MATH, add checks

    * geda-gtk.m4: Add new mcro file and relocate modules checks for GTK and
      GDK bixbuf from configure.ac to new file, Added module check for GTHREAD
      because main-line included reference to HAVE_GTHREAD, which was not ever
      getting done because HAVE_GTHREAD was not in config.h

    * geda-uri-viewer.m4: Revised so that SHOW_URI_COMMAND would be defined
      regardless of the out-come of SHOW_URI_GIO.

2013-01-06 Wiley E Hill  <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      and AC_FUNC_LSTAT_FOLLOWS_SLASHED_SYMLINK, relocated AC_HEADER_SYS_WAI
      chown, strerror strstr, getlogin
