dnl WEH 04/07/14: Changed 'AC_SUBST([LIBSTROKE_CPPFLAGS])' to 'AC_SUBST([LIBSTROKE_CFLAGS])'
dnl               This is the only occurence of 'LIBSTROKE_CPPFLAGS' in the source-tree
dnl               How long has Gschem used libstrokes? Amazingly, strokes has worked all
dnl               these years, even without pkg-config! Breaking the cardinal rule "if it
dnl               ain't broke", just this one time.
dnl               also changed test "X$HAVE_LIBSTROKE" != "Xyes" to 1 in AC_DEFINE, tired
dnl               of seeing this in config.h
