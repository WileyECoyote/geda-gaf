geda-install \- Install gEDA binaries to local bin folder

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B geda-install
.RI [ OPTIONS ] [-d folder_with_programs ] [-l folder_in_path ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B geda-install
Setup gEDA Installation

geda-install is for creating shortcut links, usually referred to as soft links, in local folders for files in the geda package folder; icons, man pages, info, etc. geda-install uses geda-install-bin to install executables This is useful after installing from the source as oppose to a distribution when the --prefix arguments was given during during configuration and can be ran after "make install" completes successfully to add links in local folders. User that install geda-gaf from a distribution package should NOT normally use this script. This allows local builds to an alternate directory such as /opt/gEDA.9 (using configure --prefix=/opt/gEDA.9) to remain "intact".

.SH QUICK
just run without in arguments after compiling geda-gaf if a configure prefix was used and was not "usr"
.B usage: [-h, --help] | [--version] | [options] [-d folder_with_programs ] [-l folder_in_path ]
example:
geda-install /opt/gEDA/bin /usr/loca/bin<ENTER>.
.SH PARAMETERS
.SH INFORMATION
Use of the following options displays information related to geda-install
but does install file or create any links:
.IP "-h, --help"
Show information about the advanced usage of this command.
.IP "-u, --usage"
Displays information on basic usage"
.IP "--version"
Displays software version information"

.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP "-f, --force"
Use for re-installing over existing data. By default geda-install does not over-write file or replace existing data links. This option causes links to be reestablished.
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Include additional information during processing.
.IP "-q, --quiet"
Suppress extraneous messages to the console.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d, --directory"
Specify the folder containing files to be linked. The default is the bin directory under "prefix", aka where the executables were installed by "make install", so this option would not normally be needed.

.IP "-l, --location"
Specify the target folder where the links are to be created. The default is /usr/local/bin, which should be suitable for most installation. Some user may prefer ~/bin.

.IP "-n, --no-trim"
By default geda-install will trim extensions from scripts, like ".sh" or ".pl" because, well, they are annoying. The justification for this is that geda-gaf utilizes different types of scripts and user should not be required to "remember" the language used for each script. This option disables this feature so that sextension are preserved during creation of the links.
