.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gmake-set-resistors
Make gEDA Resistor Symbols

gmake-set-resistors is for 'batch' setting the values in resistor symbol files for the geda-gaf project.
The gmake-set-resistors script creates a tmp directory in the current directory.
In all files in the current directory, the text "Ohms" will be substitute with
the value argument and the results put in the tmp directory. After the values are
set in the files, the strings in the file names matching "old_string" will be
replaced with "new_string". This is useful to set both the values and the file
name of a collection of template symbols with placeholder strings in the file
name to identifiers, such as real part numbers

.SH QUICK
.B usage: [-h, --help] | [--version] | [options] old_string, new_string value
example:
gmake-set-resistors gmake-set-resistors xxxxR00 180R00 180

will change  "xxxxR00" in the file names to "180R00" and the text "Ohms"
would be replaced with "180".
