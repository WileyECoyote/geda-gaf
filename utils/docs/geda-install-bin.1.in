.SH NAME
geda-install-bin \- Install gEDA binaries to local bin folder

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B geda-install-bin
.RI [ OPTIONS ] [-d folder_with_programs ] [-l folder_in_path ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B geda-install-bin
Install gEDA binaries to local bin folder

geda-install-bin is used to create shortcut links, usually referred to as soft links, in the local/bin folder for executables in the geda bin folder, both scripts and binaries. By default, extensions are removed from the script names. This is useful after installing from the source, rather than a distribution and can be ran after "make install" completes successfully to add links in the command path. This would NOT normally be necessary if geda-gaf was installed from a distribution package or if the --prefix option was NOT used during configure to install the suite in a normal system locations, i.e. either /usr or /usr/local. geda-install-bin is useful when the
--prefix option is use to install the suite in someplace like /opt/gEDA.

.SH QUICK
just run without in arguments after compiling geda-gaf if a configure prefix was used and was not "usr"
.B usage: [-h, --help] | [--version] | [options] [-d folder_with_programs ] [-l folder_in_path ]
example:
geda-install-bin /opt/gEDA/bin /usr/loca/bin<ENTER>.
.SH PARAMETERS
.SH INFORMATION
Use of the following options displays information related to geda-install-bin
but does install file or create any links:
.IP "-h, --help"
Show information about the advanced usage of this command.
.IP "-u, --usage"
Displays information on basic usage"
.IP "--version"
Displays software version information"

.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Include additional information during processing.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d, --directory"
Specify the folder containing files to be linked. The default is the bin directory under "prefix", aka where the executables were installed by "make install", so this option would not normally be needed.

.IP "-l, --location"
Specify the target folder where the links are to be created. The default is /usr/local/bin, which should be suitable for most installation. Some user may prefer ~/bin.

.IP "-n, --no-trim"
By default geda-install-bin will trim extensions from scripts, like ".sh" or ".pl" because, well, they are annoying. The justification for this is that geda-gaf utilizes different types of scripts and user should not be required to "remember" the language used for each script. This option disables this feature so that extension are preserved during creation of the links.
