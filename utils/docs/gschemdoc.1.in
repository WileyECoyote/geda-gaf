.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBgschemdoc\fR is shell script that attempts to present relevant information
or documentation with regard to a specifc component, manual, or URL. The order
of arguments sets the presidence used by \fBgschemdoc\fR, with the first argument,
\fIDOCUMENTATION\fR, having the highest priority.
.PP
The \fIDOCUMENTATION\fR argument can be a URL, either local or remote, or a PDF
file. Without an option, the \fIGEDADOCDIR\fR directory is checked first, if a
file is not found and a BROWSER is found then the \fIDOCUMENTATION\fR is passed
to the browser. If the \fIDOCUMENTATION\fR argument is empty, the scripts checks
for DEVICE-VALUE.pdf and then a DEVICE.pdf in the \fIGEDADOCDIR\fR directory,
followed by browsing for "DEVICE VALUE" if a BROWSER was found and the \fIVALUE\fR
argument is present, otherwise only browsing for "DEVICE". If a BROWSER was
not found, then the scripts attempts to locate a pdf file in \fIGEDADOCDIR\fR
directory with the base name of \fISYMBOL\fR.
