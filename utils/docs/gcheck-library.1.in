Directives affecting the mode and operation of the gcheck-library utility.
.IP "-a, --all"
file search pattern is changed from *.sym to *'.
.IP "-c, --clip"
Performs advanced checks on geda-clib.scm. This directive is not intended for regular users. When enabled, symbol files are
not checked, instead, gcheck-library will perform checks related to geda-clib.scm in two stages. The first check is for the
syntax of geda-clib.scm. The gaf utility's shell feature is utilized to load the file in guile, this is a pass or fail check.
The results are reported. The second stage checks for references to the names of symbol folders in geda-clib.scm, which
uses the "component-library" function to load the main library, so any folder names reported as being unreferenced will not
appear in the component selection dialog in gschem. Note that this directive can only be used in the installed location
of the geda-clib.scm or in the source directory containing the geda-clib.scm.
.IP "-d, --docs"
Check validity of URL referenced by documentation attributes.
.IP "-f, --filter"
The Filter directive is intended to over-ride the internal default symbol file type.
