.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gfix-library
A script to assist in maintaining symbol libraries

This a wrapper script for gsymfix to repair a collection of symbol. gsymfix creates a new file with the same name and adds '.fix' as a suffix. By default gfix-library removes the orginal file and renames the new ".fix" file to the same as the orginal so as to replace the orginal symbol files. The --keep parameter can be used to retain the old symbol files if desired.
