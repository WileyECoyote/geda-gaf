gsch2pcb Changelog
------------------
1.11
---------

2015-12-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gsch2pcb/gsch2pcb.c: Free allocated PcbElement structures in global
      pcb_element_list before exiting main. This only seems to be necessary
      when running gsch2pcb is ran on an existing PCB project and elements
      were added or replaced.

      Reduce scope of char *close_char, and integers state and elcount in
      function pcb_element_line_parse().

      Removed unused definition of ElementMap structure.

------------------
1.10.3
---------

2015-11-29 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gsch2pcb/gsch2pcb.c: Replace g_list_free_full with u_glist_free_full
      in main function and this allows building on systems with less than
      glib-2.28.

2015-11-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gsch2pcb/gsch2pcb.c: Change argument name for function load_project
      from "path" to "filename", add ~/etc/gsch2pcb onto list of directory
      to check for "extra" settings. Add some Doxygen comments.

------------------
1.10.2
---------

2015-10-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gsch2pcb/gsch2pcb.c: Remove deadwood, minor reformatting, bump version
      to 1.10 in source, is version 1.10.2 in change log.

------------------
1.10.1
---------
2016-01-13 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gsch2pcb/gsch2pcb.c: Fix variable name for non Linux builds;
      home -> get_home_dir, not bumping version.

2015-10-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gsch2pcb/gsch2pcb.c: Revised function load_extra_project_files to
      call libgeda to get the user config directory instead of hard-coding
      ".gEDA" so gsch2pcb can be XDG compliant if this option was compiled
      into geda-gaf.

      Add new function const char *get_home_dir as static inline, called by
      expand_dir and add_default_m4_files. The new function uses enviroment
      varible for target is LINUX. This is done to avoid slice allocations
      by glib. Fix indirect? leak; free default_m4_pcbdir in main.

1.9.2
---------
2015-10-19 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gsch2pcb/gsch2pcb.c: Unconditionally free verboseList in function
      run_gnetlist. Initialize schematics list in main and free before
      exiting main, along with all of the string file names reference by
      the list using g_list_free_full. Free pcb_new_file_name in main.
      Revise function pcb_element_line_parse to only set the element list
      pointer to NULL if the line was not an Element line.Add missing call
      to pcb_element_free in function add_elements, clean and reformat
      code to improve readability.

1.9.1
---------
2015-10-18 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * gsch2pcb/gsch2pcb.c: Revise function add_multiple_schematics to append
      the file names directly to the list of schematics so that add_schematic
      does not set sch_basename when a project files is used. The parse_config
      function also sets sch_basename if an output options is give and this
      memory is not be released. And this allow the a trailing output name on
      the command line because function get_args calls add_schematic. Add a
      warning in parse_config if multiple output specifications are detected.
      Revise parse_config to continue with elif format instead of switching
      to nested if format in the middle of checking for options. Initialize
      sch_basename in main and free before exiting main.

---------
2015-10-17 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * utils/gsch2pcb/gsch2pcb.c: Revise function build_and_run_command to use
      local scoping for variables; error, standard_output and standard_error,
      args and status. Eliminate unnecessary local scoping for variable i.
      Major modifications to function run_gnetlist to use local scoping and
      results variable to run build_and_run_command and remove early returns
      and this allows resources to be released if errors are encountered.
      Replace g_new0 with GEDA_MEM_ALLOC0. Free pcb_element_list file names
      before exiting program. Increment GSC2PCB_VERSION.

2015-10-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * utils/gsch2pcb: Relocate gsch2pcb to it's own src folder.

2015-10-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * utils/src/gsch2pcb.c:utils/gsch2pcb: fix bugs: see commit to master branch
      2181abe63512c7b5ad2279ab4609878586d497a2 by Sergey Stepanov:

    * expand_dir(): Dereference of null pointer (loaded from variable 'dir')
    * possible resource leak (as pointer to allocated memory by expand_dir()
      is lost after printf())

2015-08-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * utils/src/gsch2pcb.c: Use explicit length as argument to strncmp.

2015-06-27 Vladimir Zhbanov <vzhbanov@gmail.com>

    * utils/src/gsch2pcb.c: WEH: Modified per commit to Master branch by
      Vladimir Zhbanov See commit fd130bf9c522faa902e06232548c5ca7dd0bdf90;
      This patch fixes output of the m4 dir when the user calls gsch2pcb
      without args. Before now, the directory was not defined in such a
      case and gsch2pcb output "(null)". Now it behaves the same way as if
      '--help' was given.

    * utils/src/gsch2pcb.c: WEH: Modified per commit to Master branch by
      Vladimir Zhbanov See commit 317a042ab4ae3044018e1fa4f141245833ff95fa;
      gsch2pcb: Slightly shift down text to make m4-pcbdir more visible.

1.8
---------
2014-07-14 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * gsch2pcb.c: Replace g_strdup with geda_strdup, replace g_strndup with
          geda_strndup, replace g_strdup_printf with geda_sprintf, replace g_free
          with GEDA_FREE

        * src/Makefile.am: Link gsch2pcb against libgeda.

2012-12-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * gsch2pcb.c: Rectified unused variables and functions.

1.5
---------
	* Fix handling of quoted flags in new CVS PCB versions.

1.4
---------
	* Handle the hi_res PCB Element[] format which is new in PCB CVS (as
	  of 1/9/2004).

1.3
---------
	* Add empty-footprint option and give special treatment to "none"
	  footprint attributes.  See discussion in the project.sample file.

1.2
---------
	* Dan McMahill updated the gnet-gsch2pcb.scm file to quote the m4
	  PKG_ args to prevent arg expansions and to allow commas in component
	  values.  M4 processing removes that quoting, however, so that info
	  is lost when processing for file elements.  I fixed gsch2pcb to try to
	  adjust for that, but there still might be a rare case where using a comma
	  in a component value will cause a file element search to fail.
	* Added "gnetlist" option so you can have other gnetlist commands run
	  from the project file.  For example, put in the project file:
	      gnetlist partslist3
	  to create myproject.partslist3 when gsch2pcb myproject is run.

1.1
---------
	* Automatically check for PCB install of the m4 and newlib directories
	  under /usr/share or /usr/local/share as it's likely to be for PCB
	  versions >= 20031113.  The tutorial is updated to reflect this.
	* Fix bug when linked to glib1.2 instead of glib2.0 which caused
	  gsch2pcb to fail to read element files.

1.0.1
---------
	* Change use-modules usage in gnet-sch2pcb.scm that worked in guile 1.4
	  but did not work in guile 1.6.

1.0
---------
	* Added --m4-command, --m4-pcbdir, and --m4-file options as suggested
	  by Dan McMahill.  Updated gnet-gsch2pcb.scm to use these options
	  via the new 20030901 gnetlist -m option.
	* Options which can be common to all an individual users projects can
	  be in ~/.gsch2pcb.  CAD administrators can put site wide options in
	  /etc/gsch2pcb or /usr/local/etc/gsch2pcb.
	* Added the project.sample file.  Read it for a description of the
	  new m4-xxxx options.
	* Expand a leading '~' to the home dir in elements-dir directories.
	* Look for /usrlib/pcb_lib and /usr/local/lib/pcb_lib.

0.9
---
	* If a file element's coordinate (mark x or y) is > 1000 (mils), translate
	  it to 1000 to avoid inserted file elements being scattered all over the
	  place.  Assume that for element coordinates < 1000 the element creator
	  was concerned with a sane initial placement...
	* Handle spaces in file element names so PCB file element names such
	  as "100 Pin jack" in the default pcb_lib directory can be used as
	  gschem footprints.
	* Search command line and project file element directories before the
	  default directories.
	* Give Makefile install target a gsch2pcb dependency.

0.8
---
	* --elements-dir option single char variant renamed from -e to -d.
	* added -f, --use-files option to force using the file element for
	  new footprints if the file element exists even though an m4 element
	  may have been found for the footprint.
	* Improved statistics reporting.
	* Some bug fixes.

0.7
---
	* Use my own gnet-gsch2pcb.scm instead working around PCBboard problems
	  or relying on a patch.
	  This fixes:
	       footprint being stored into element issue.
	       gnetlist output doesn't abort with unfound elements so gsch2pcb
	       won't unexpectedly delete all elements.
	* Default install is to /usr instead of /usr/local because
	  gnet-gsch2pcb.scm must be installed under the same dir as the  existing
	  gnetlist, and this is more likely /usr.  See the INSTALL file.

0.6
---
	* Forward annotate schematic component "value" attribute changes to
	  pcb element "value" fields.

0.5
---
	* Cleaned up the output reporting.

0.4
---
	* project files
	* Don't use schematic "value" attribute and element "value" in the
	  comparison to determine when an element for a footprint already exists.
	* include a gnet-PCBboard-patch in the distribution so people can fix
	  gnetlist to save footprint information in m4 pcb elements.
	* --fix-elements option so existing PCB files can have their elements
	  Description fields updated to schematic footprint values without
	  deleting the elements.  If the above patch is applied and there are
	  existing pcb files with m4 elements, gsch2pcb should be run with this
	  option to fix the pcb files.

0.3
---
	* Add --preserve option to prevent removing .pcb file elements which
	  are not found in the schematics.
	* Regardless of the --preserve, don't ever delete elements which have
	  no layout-name (refdes) because these are likey elements not intended to
	  be on the schematic.

0.2
---
	* When substituting values into Element() lines, put gschem "footprint"
	  values into the PCB Element "description" position instead of
	  gschem "device" values.  This is different from existing
	  "gnetlist -g PCBboard" behaviour which uses the "device" value, but
	  keeping footprint info in the layout seems far more valuable to me.
	  Now a component can have its footprint changed and gsch2pcb will
	  be able recognize the change and delete the old component and add in
	  the new.  But, this only works for newly added file elements.  Any
	  existing .pcb file will have "device" values stored so a "footprint"
	  change cannot be recognized.  See comment at top of gsch2pcb.c.

	* Initial release
